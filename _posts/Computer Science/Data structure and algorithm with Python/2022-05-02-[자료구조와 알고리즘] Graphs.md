# Dictionary and Copy in Python

AL09-3

## Python Dictionary

- An unordered collection of items: Each item has a key/value pair 
  - Dictionary is mutable and iterable 
  - Keys are unique and must be immutable

# Graph and its Representations

AL09-11

## Graphs

A graph is a set of vertices and edges that form connections between the vertices. In a more formal approach, a graph **G** is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, given as G = (V, E) in formal mathematical notation.

**Definition**

- A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. A simple path is one with no repeated vertices. A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. A simple cycle is a cylce with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices). The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.



**Definition**

- A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph. A graph that is not connected consists of a set of connected compononents, which are maximal connected subgraphs.

AL 09-13

**Definition**

- A tree is an acyclic connected graph. A disjoint set of trees is called a forest.

<br>

For, example, a graph G with V vertices is a tree if and only if it satisfies any of the following five conditions:

- G has V-1 edges and no cycles.
- G has V-1 edges and is connected.
- G is connected, but removing any edge disconnects it.
- G is acylclic, but adding any edge creates a cycle.
- Exactly one simple path connects each pair of vertices in G.

## Directed graphs

In a directed graph, the edges provide the information on the direction of connection between any two nodes in a graph.

- Undirected graph 
- Indegree 
- Outdegree
- (directed) path 
- (directed) cycle

## Weighted graphs

A weighted graph is a graph that has a numeric weight associated with the edges in the graph. It can be either a directed or an undirected graph. This numerical value can possibly be used to indicate distance or cost, depending upon the purpose of the graph.

In this example, AD and ABCD represent two different paths.
