# Chapter 4: Multithreaded Programming

- Overview 
- Multicore Programming 
- Multithreading Models 
- Thread Libraries  
- Implicit Threading 
- Threading Issues 
- Operating System Examples
  -  Windows XP Threads 
  - Linux Threads 
  - Java Threads



<br>

## Objectives

- To introduce the notion of a thread 
  - a fundamental unit of CPU utilization(CPU 활용의 기본 단위) that forms the basis of multithreaded computer systems 

- To discuss the APIs for the Pthreads, Win32, and Java thread libraries 
- To explore several strategies that provide implicit threading 
- To examine issues related to multithreaded programming 
- To cover operating system support for threads in Windows and Linux



<br>

## Motivation

- Most modern applications are multithreaded 
  - Threads run within application 
- Many s/w packages that run on modern desktop PCs are **multithreaded** 
  - An application is implemented as a separate process with several threads of control 
  - concurrently 실행!!!!!!!
  - A web browser might have one thread display images or text 
    - While another thread retrieves data from network 
    - And another update display 
    - Answer a network request
  - Word processor may have a thread for displaying graphics 
    - Another thread for reading keystrokes 
    - Another for performing spelling checking in the background 
- Web server 
  - A web server accepts client requests for web pages 
  - A busy web server may have several clients concurrently accessing 
- RPC 
  - RPC severs are multithreaded



<br>

## Thread - motivation

- Process creation is heavy-weight while **thread creation is light-weight** 
- Can simplify code, increase efficiency 
- OS Kernels are also generally multithreaded



<br>

## Multithreaded Server Architecture

<br>

## Threads

-  Process is an executing program with a single thread of control 
- Modern OS allows for a process to contain multiple threads of control 



-  A thread (or lightweight process) is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it consists of: 
  - Thread ID, program counter 
  - register set 
  - stack space 
-  A thread shares with its peer threads its: 
  - code section 
  - data section 
  - operating-system resources such as open files and signals 
-  A traditional or heavyweight process is equal to a task with one thread



<br>

## Multiple Threads within a Task

![image-20220926164453069](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926164453069.png)

- In a multiple threaded task, **while one server thread is blocked and waiting**, a second thread in the same task can run. 
  - Cooperation of multiple threads in same job confers higher throughput and improved performance. 
  - Applications that require sharing a common buffer (i.e., producer-consumer) benefit from thread utilization. 
- Threads provide a mechanism that allows sequential processes to make blocking system calls(ex. syscall) while also achieving parallelism.

<br>

## Single and Multithreaded Processes

![image-20220926164515381](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926164515592.png)

- code, data, files는 여러 프로세스가 생겨도 공유된다.
- 하지만 각 프로세스 별로 실행되는 과정을 다르기 때문에 registers와 stack은 따로 따로 갖게 된다.

<br>

## Benefits of multithreaded programming

- **Responsiveness** 
  - Allow a program to continue running even if part of it is blocked or is performing a lengthy operation 
  - Multithreaded web browser allow user interaction in one thread while an image is being loaded in another thread 
- **Resource Sharing** 
  - Threads share the memory and resources of the process 
  - threads share resources of process, easier than shared memory or message passing 
    - Threads make IPC easier
  - **Code sharing** allows an application to have several threads within same address space 
- **Economy** 
  - Allocating resources for process creation is costly 
  - More economical to **create** and **context switch** threads (resource sharing) 
  - In solaris 2, creating process is about 30 times slower than is creating a thread, context switching is about 5 times slower



- **Scalability** 
  - process can take advantage of multiprocessor architectures Utilization of MP Architectures 
  - Benefits of multiprogramming can be greatly increased in MP architecture, where each thread may be running in parallel on a different processor 
  - A single threaded process can only run on one CPU, no matter how many are available 
  - Multithreading on a multi-CPU machine increases concurrency 
  - In a single-processor architecture, the CPU moves between each thread as to create an illusion of parallelism, but in reality only one thread is running at a time (pseduo parallel)






<br>

## Multicore Programming

- Single CPU -> multi CPU -> multi-core CPU on single CPU chip
- Each core appears as a separate CPU to OS (4core -> OS가 보기에 4CPU)
- Multi-threaded programming can provide **Improved concurrency** on multi-core system
  - Concurrency means **Parallelism**
    - a system can perform more then one task **simultaneosly**
  - Concurrnecy means pseudo-parallelism
    - supports more than one task making progress (계속해서 진전이 이루어진다는 점)
    - Single processor / core, (OS)scheduler providing concurrency 



- Multicore systems putting **pressure on programmers**, challenges include: 
  - Dividing activities - identify task that can run in parallel on individual core.
    - Each task should be independent to be executed on parallel
  - Balance (한 core가 너무 많은 하지 않도록 - 골고루)
  - Data splitting 
  - Data dependency - when one task depends on data from another, execution of tasks should be synchronized to accommodate data dependency
  - Testing and debugging 
- Parallelism implies a system can perform more than one task simultaneously 



- Types of parallelism 
  - **Data parallelism** - distributes subsets of the same data across multiple cores, same operation on each 
  - **Task parallelism** - distributing threads across cores, each thread performing unique operation 

- As # of threads grows, so does architectural support for threading 
  - CPUs have cores as well as **hardware threads** 
  - Consider Oracle SPARC T4 with 8 cores, and 8 hardware threads per core (OS관점 64개 core)

<br>

## Concurrency vs. Parallelism

- Concurrent execution on single-core system:
  - ![image-20220926165019134](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926165019134.png)
- Parallelism on a multi-core system:
  - ![image-20220926165044709](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926165044709.png)



<br>

## Amdahl's Law

- Identifies performance gains from adding additional cores to an application that has both serial and parallel components 
- S is serial portion (병렬 불가능한 것의 비율)
- N processing cores 

![image-20220926165145703](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926165145703.png)

- I.e. if application is 75% parallel / 25% serial, moving from 1 to 2 cores results in speedup of 1.6 times, 2.28 times with 4 cores

- **As N approaches infinity**, speedup approaches 1 / S 

  - if 50% serial, max speedup is 2.0

  

  **Serial portion of an application has disproportionate effect on performance gained by adding additional cores** 

- But does the law take into account contemporary multicore systems?



<br>

## User Threads and Kernel Threads

- **User threads** - management done by user-level threads library 
- Three primary thread libraries: 
  - POSIX Pthreads 
  - Windows threads 
  - Java threads 
- **Kernel threads** - Supported by the Kernel 
- Examples – virtually all general purpose operating systems, including: 
  - Windows 
  - Solaris 
  - Linux  
  - Tru64 UNIX 
  - Mac OS X



<br>

## User Level Threads

- Thread management done by user-level threads library 
- Three primary thread libraries: 
  - POSIX Pthreads 
  - Win32 threads 
  - Java threads 
- supported above the kernel, via a set of thread library calls at the user level (Project Andrew from CMU). 
- The library supports for thread creation, scheduling in user space with no kernel support 
- Kernel is unaware of user-level threads, **so fast** 
  - Drawbacks 
    - If the kernel is single threaded, then any user-level thread performing a blocking system call will cause the entire process to block, even if other threads are available to run within the application



<br>

## Kernel Threads

- Kernel-supported Threads Supports for threads is provided by OS 
  - The kernel performs thread creation, scheduling in kernel space
  -  단점: Generally slower to manage threads than user thread 
  - 장점: But, if a thread performs a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another thread for execution 
  - In MP environment, the kernel can schedule threads on different processors 
  - Examples – virtually all general purpose operating systems, including: 
    - Windows XP/2000, Solaris, Linux, Tru64 UNIX, Mac OS X 
- Hybrid approach implements both user-level and kernel-supported threads (Solaris 2). 
- Java thread on JVM



<br>

## Multithreading Models

- Many systems provide support both user and kernel threads, resulting in different multithreading models 



- Many-to-One 
- One-to-One 
- Many-to-Many



<br>

## Multithreading Models

### Many-to-One 

- Many user-level thread mapped to single kernel thread. 
- Thread management is **done in user space**, so efficient 
- Because only one thread can access the kernel at a time, multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on MPs 
  - Multiple threads **may not run in parallel** on muticore system because only one may be in kernel at a time 
  - Allows the developer to create as many user threads, however, true concurrency is not gained because kernel can schedule only one thread at a time 
- Overhead - but entire process will block if a thread makes a blocking system call 
  - One thread blocking causes all to block 
- Used on systems that do not support kernel threads (user-level thread libraries) – Few systems currently use this model 
- Examples: 
  - Solaris Green Threads 
  - GNU Portable Threads



<br>

## Multithreading Models: Many-to-One Model

![image-20220926165939792](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926165939792.png)

- 4개의 thread 중 어느 thread가 실행되기 위해서 하나의 kernel thread에 할당이 되어야 한다.
  - 그러면 kernel은 하나가 돌든 두개가 돌든 전체의 user thread를 하나의 thread로 간주하게 된다.
- kernel thread가 하나의 single thread이면 위의 4개의 user thread 중 하나만 block이 되더라도 나머지가 다 block이 되어 버리게 되는 문제가 있을 수 있다.

<br>

## One-to-one Model

- Each user-level thread maps to kernel thread. 
- Creating a user-level thread creates a kernel thread 
- provides more concurrency than many-to-one model by allowing another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call or by allowing multiple threads to run in parallel (concurrently) on MPs 
- Disadv. 
  - -> creating a user thread requires creating the corresponding kernel thread 
  - -> Number of threads per process sometimes **restricted** due to overhead 
- Examples 
  - Windows NT/XP/2000, Linux, Solaris 9 and later, OS/2


![image-20220926170037770](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926170037770.png)



<br>

## Many-to-Many Model

- one-to-one과 many-to-many의 장단점을 섞은 model
- Allows many user level threads to be mapped to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads. 
- Allows the operating system to create a sufficient number of kernel threads. 
- In many-to-one model, true concurrency is not gained because kernel can schedule only one thread at a time 
- One-to-one model allows greater concurrency, but, overhead of creating kernel threads can burden the performance of an application 
- Solaris prior to version 9 
- Windows NT/2000 with the ThreadFiber package 
- Solaris 2, IRIX, HP-UX, True64 Unix



![image-20220926170135415](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926170135415.png)

<br>

## Two-level Model

- Similar to M:M, except that it allows a user thread to be **bound** to kernel thread 
- Examples 
  - IRIX 
  - HP-UX 
  - Tru64 UNIX 
  - Solaris 8 and earlier

![image-20220926170218499](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926170218499.png)



<br>

## Thread Libraries

- **Thread library** provides programmer with API for creating and managing threads 
- Two primary ways of implementing 
  - Library entirely in user space 
  - Kernel-level library supported by the OS



<br>

## Pthreads

- May be provided either as user-level or kernel-level 
- A POSIX standard (IEEE 1003.1c) API for thread creation and synchronization 
- A specification for thread behavior, not an implementation 
  - API specifies behavior of the thread library, implementation is up to development of the library. 
- Common in UNIX operating systems (Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X)



<br>

## Pthreads Example

![image-20220926170338801](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926170338801.png)

- pthread_create: fork()와 유사한

- pthread_join: wait()과 유사한



<br>

## Pthreads Code for Joining 10 Threads

<br>

## Win32 API Multithreaded C Program

- CreateThread
- WaitForSingleObject

<br>

## Java Threads

- Most PL(Programming Language) do not enable programmers to specify concurrent activities except Ada 
  - Generally concurrency has been implemented as OS primitives 
  - C , C++ programs can perform multithreading by using platform-specific code libraries 

- Java provide supports at the language level 
- threads are managed by the JVM not by user library or kernel. 
  - Typically implemented using the threads model provided by underlying OS 
- Java threads may be created by: 
  - Extending Thread class - creating a new class that is derived from the Thread class, and to override the run method of the Thread class 
  - Implementing the Runnable interface

![image-20220926170617522](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926170617522.png)

## Multi-threaded program for Summation of a non-negative integer

```java
class Summation extends Thread
{
    public Summation (int n) {
        upper = n;
    }
    public void run ( ) {
        int sum = 0;

        if ( upper > 0 ) {
            for ( int i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
                sum += i ;
        }
        System.out.println (“the sum of “+upper+” is “ +sum);
    }

    private int upper;
}
class Summation extends Thread
{
    public Summation (int n) {
        upper = n;
    }
    public void run ( ) {
        int sum = 0;

        if ( upper > 0 ) {
            for ( int i = 1; i <= upper; i++)
                sum += i ;
        }
        System.out.println (“the sum of “+upper+” is “ +sum);
    }

    private int upper;
}

public class ThreadTester
{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        if (args.length > 0){
            Summation thrd = new Summation (Integer.parseInt (args[0]));
            thrd.start(); //create thread//
        }
        else
            System.err.println("usage: Summation <integer value>");
    }

}
```



- start method 
  - Allocates memory and initializes a new thread in JVM 
  - Calls run method, making the thread eligible to be run by JVM



<br>

## Multiple threads

```java
public class ThreadTester {
    Public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
        PrintThread thread1 = new PrintThread ( “thread1” );
        PrintThread thread2 = new PrintThread ( “thread2” );
        PrintThread thread3 = new PrintThread ( “thread3” );
        System.err.println ("starting threads");
        thread1.start( ); thread2.start( ); thread3.start( );
        System.err.println (“threads started, main ends \n” threads” );
    }
}
class PrintThread extends Thread {
    private int sleepTime;
    
    public PrintThread ( String name ){
        super (name);
        sleepTime = (int) (math.random() * 5001 );
    }
    
    public void run ( ) {
        try {System.err.println (getName() + “going to sleep for ” + sleepTime);
             Threads.sleep (sleepTime);
            };
        System.err.println (getName() + “done sleeping ” );
    }
```

<br>

## Java Thread States

- Blocked : waiting (wait) -> notify, notifyall, T/O interrupt 
  - sleeping (sleep) -> sleep interval expire interupt 
  - blocked (io, synch) -> i/o complete, lock acqusition interrupt 
- Runnable: ready -> running : thread dispatch
  - running -> ready : quantum expire, yield

![image-20220926171356470](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926171356470.png)

<br>

## JVM &amp; Host OS

- JVM is on top of a host OS 
  - Allows the JVM to **hide** the implementation details of underlying OS 
  - Provide a consistent, abstract environment that allows java programs to operate on any platform that supports a JVM 
- JAVA spec. does not specify how java threads are to be mapped to OS 
  - Windows 95/98/NT/2000 use **one-to-one model** - each java thread for a JVM maps to a kernel thread 
  - Solaris 2 implements JVM as many-to-one model 
    - With Solaris 2.6, JVM was implemented using many-to-many model



<br>

## Linux Thread States

![image-20221002200237388](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221002200237388.png)

running 상태에서 일정 시간 이상 머물게 되면 강제로 ready state로 보낸다.

<br>

## Implicit Threading

- Growing in popularity as numbers of threads increase, program correctness more difficult with **explicit threads** 
  - 버그를 찾는 것이 어려워짐
  - explicit threads: 프로그램을 작성한 사용자가 직접 실행한 thread

- Creation and management of threads done **by compilers and run-time libraries rather than programmers** 
  - **-> implicit thread**

- Three methods explored 
  - Thread Pools 
  - OpenMP 
  - Grand Central Dispatch 
- Other methods include Microsoft Threading Building Blocks (TBB), java.util.concurrent package



<br>

## Thread Pools

- Create a number of threads in a pool where they await work - thread 그릇은 사전에 만들어 놓는 것
- Advantages: 
  - Usually slightly faster to service a request with an existing thread than create a new thread 
  - Allows the number of threads in the application(s) to be bound to the size of the pool 
  - Separating `task to be performed from mechanics of creating task` allows different strategies for running task 
    - i.e.Tasks could be scheduled to run periodically 
- Windows API supports thread pools:

![image-20220926171943246](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926171943246.png)



<br>

## OpenMP

- Set of compiler directives and an API for C, C++, FORTRAN 
- Provides support for parallel programming in shared-memory environments 
- Identifies **parallel regions** – blocks of code that can run in parallel

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926172027205.png" alt="image-20220926172027205"  /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926172036706.png" alt="image-20220926172036706" style="zoom:67%;" />





<br>

## Grand Central Dispatch

- Apple technology for Mac OS X and iOS operating systems 
- Extensions to C, C++ languages, API, and run-time library 
- **Allows identification of parallel sections** 
- Manages most of the details of threading 
- Block is in `“^{ }”` 
  - ex) `ˆ{ printf("I am a block"); } `

- Blocks placed in dispatch queue 
  - Assigned to available thread in thread pool when removed from queue 
- Two types of dispatch queues: 
  - serial – blocks removed in FIFO order, queue is per process, called main queue 
    - Programmers can create additional serial queues within program 
  - concurrent – removed in FIFO order but several may be removed at a time

![image-20220926172224980](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926172224980.png)



<br>

## Threading Issues

- Semantics of fork() and exec() system calls. 
- Thread cancellation. 
  - Asynchronous or deferred 
- Signal handling 
  - Synchronous and asynchronous 
- Thread pools 
- Thread specific data 
  - Create Facility needed for data private to thread 
- Scheduler activations



<br>



## fork() and exec() system calls

- In a multithreaded program, the semantics of **fork**, **exec** change 
- Does **fork()** duplicate only the calling thread or all threads? 
  - fork를 하는 경우 모든 thread를 복제해야 하는가?
  - If one thread in a program calls fork, does the new process duplicate all threads or is the new process single-threaded ? 
- Unix has **2 versions** 
  - One that duplicates all threads 
  - Another that duplicates only the thread that invoked fork 
- **Exec()** usually works as normal – replace the running process including all threads (process 동작과 거의 동일)
  - If a thread invokes the exec system call, the program specified in the parameter to exec **will replace the entire process (all threads)**



<br>

## Thread cancellation (1/2)

- Task of terminating a thread before it has completed 
- Ex) multiple threads are concurrently searching through a DB and one thread returns the result. 
  - A thread that is to be cancelled is referred to as target thread 
- Two general approaches: 
  - **Asynchronous cancellation** -> one thread immediately terminates the target thread 
    - 자원 반납할 여유도 없이 terminate
  - **Deferred cancellation** -> the target thread can **periodically check** if it should terminate, allowing the target thread an opportunity to terminate itself in an orderly fashion 
    - Flag checking
    - 자원 반납을 스스로하게 될 여유를 줌.
- Pthread code to create and cancel a thread:

![image-20220926172558722](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926172558722.png)



<br>

- Invoking thread cancellation requests cancellation, but actual cancellation depends on thread state

![image-20220926172643608](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220926172643608.png)

- If thread has cancellation disabled, cancellation **remains pending** until thread enables it 
- **Default** type is **deferred** 
  - Cancellation only occurs when thread reaches **cancellation point** 
  - I.e. pthread_testcancel() 
  - Then **cleanup handler** is invoked 
- On Linux systems, thread cancellation is handled through signals



- How about the resources that are allocated to the thread? 
- If a thread was cancelled while in the middle of updating **data it is sharing with other threads**? 
  - With asynchronous cancellation, OS may not free a system-wide resource 
  - With synchronous cancellation, cancellation points should be defined

<br>

## Signal handling (1/3)

- A signal is used to **notify** a process that a particular event has occurred 

  - A signal is generated by the occurrence of a particular event 
  - A generated signal is delivered to a process 
  - Once delivered, the signal must be handled by one of two signal handlers: 

    1. default 


    2. user-defined 


- Delivery of signal can be done either synchronously or asynchronously 
  - **Synch**: illegal memory access, division by zero 
    - signal is delivered **to the same process** that performed the operation **causing the signal** 
  - **Asynch**: generated by an event **external to a running process** 
    - Terminating a process  ctrl + c 
    - Typically asynchronous signals are sent to another process



<br>

## Signal handling (2/3)

- Every signal may be handled by 
  - A default signal handler 
  - A user-defined handler 
- Every signal has a default signal handler that is run by the kernel 
- The default signal handler is **overridden** by a user-defined signal handler 
  - user defined signal handler가 있다면 ! default 무시 -> user defined 실행

- Handling signals in single-threaded programs is straightforward 
  - Signals are always delivered to a process

<br>

## Signal handling (3/3)

- Where then should a signal be delivered for **multi-threaded**? 
  - Deliver the signal to **the thread** to which the signal applies 
    - **Synchronous** signal 
    - 직접적 연결이 있는 thread에 signal 전달하는
  - Deliver the signal to **every thread** in the process 
    - **Asynchronous** signal such as  c 
  - Deliver the signal to **certain threads** in the process 
    - Some unix allows a thread to specify which signals it will accept or and which it will block 
    - Delivered only to the first thread found in a process that is not blocking the signal 
  - Assign a specific thread to receive all signals for the process 
    - Solaris 2
    
     
- Window 2000 : asynchronous procedure call (APC) 
  - Allows a user thread to specify a function that is to be called when the user thread receives notification of a particular event 
  - Similar to asynchronous signal

## Thread pools

- Scenario of multithreading a web server 
  - Creating a separate thread is superior to separate process 
  - But, it also has problems 
  - Time required to create the thread 
  - Unlimited thread creation could exhaust system resources 
- Create a number of threads at process startup and place them in pool 
- Advantages: 
  - Usually slightly faster to service a request with an existing thread than create a new thread 
  - Allows the number of threads in the application(s) to be bound to the size of the pool



<br>

## Thread-specific data (Thread-Local Storage)

- Threads belonging to a process share the data of the process 
  - Benefits of multithreaded programming 
- However, 때때로, each thread might need its own copy of certain data 
  - Allows each thread to have its own copy of data 
  - **Thread-local storage (TLS)** allows each thread to have its own copy of data 
  - Most thread libraries provide the thread-specific data 
  - Win32, Pthreads, Java • Useful when you do not have control over the thread creation process (i.e., when using a thread pool) 
- Different from local variables 
- Local variables visible only during single function invocation 
  - TLS visible across function invocations 
  - Similar to static data 
- TLS is unique to each thread



<br>

## Scheduler Activations

- Both M:M and Two-level models require communication to maintain the appropriate number of kernel threads allocated to the application 
- Typically use an intermediate data structure between user and kernel threads - **lightweight process (LWP)** 
  - Appears to be a **virtual processor** on which process can schedule user thread to run 
  - Each LWP attached to kernel thread 
  - How many LWPs to create? 
- Scheduler activations provide **upcalls** - a communication mechanism from the kernel to the thread library 
- This communication allows an application to maintain the correct number kernel threads

## Threads Support in Solaris 2

- Solaris 2 is a version of UNIX with support for threads at the kernel and user levels, symmetric multiprocessing, and real-time scheduling. 
- Implements many-to-many model  Implements the Pthread API, UI threads 
  - User level threads with a library containing APIs for thread creation and management  
  - Developers opt for Pthread library



<br>

## Threads Support in Solaris 2

- LWP – intermediate level between user-level threads and kernel-level threads. 
  - Each process contains at least one LWP 
  - Thread library multiplexes user-level threads on the pool of LWPs for the process 
  - Only user-level threads currently connected to an LWP accomplish work 
  - The rest one are either blocked or waiting for an LWP on which they can run 
- Kernel-level thread 
  - Each LWP has an kernel-level thread 
  - Some kernel-level threads run on the kernel’s behalf and have no associated LWP (a thread to service disk request) 
  - The only objects scheduled for CPU

- User-level threads may be either bound or unbound 
- A bound thread 
  - permanently attached to an LWP 
  - Runs on the LWP, and by request the LWP can be dedicated to a single processor 
  - Binding a thread is useful in situations that require quick response time, such as real-time app. 
- An unbound thread (default) 
- is not permanently attached to an LWP 
- All unbound threads in an application are multiplexed onto the pool of available LWPS for the application

<br>

## Data structures to implement threads on Solaris 2

- Kernel thread: 
  - small data structure and a stack 
  - Copy of kernel registers 
  - A pointer to LWP to which it is attached 
  - A priority 
- LWP: kernel data structures 
  - register set for the user-level thread it is running 
  - accounting and memory information 
  - switching between LWPs is relatively slow. 
- User-level thread: exists in user space 
  - Thread ID, register set including PC and SP 
  - Stack, priority for scheduling 
  - no kernel involvement means fast switching.

## Windows Threads

- Windows implements the Windows API – primary API for Win 98, Win NT, Win 2000, Win XP, and Win 7 
- Implements the one-to-one mapping, kernel-level 
  - Each user-level thread maps to an associated kernel thread 
- Each thread contains 
  - a thread id 
  - register set representing state of processor 
  - separate user and kernel stacks for when thread runs in user mode or kernel mode 
  - private data storage area used by run-time library and dynamic link libraries (DLLs) 
- The register set, stacks, and private storage area are known as the context of the threads 
- The primary data structures of a thread include: 
  - ETHREAD (executive thread block) – includes pointer to process to which thread belongs and to KTHREAD, in kernel space 
  - KTHREAD (kernel thread block) – scheduling and synchronization info, kernel-mode stack, pointer to TEB, in kernel space 
  - TEB (thread environment block) - thread id, user-mode stack, thread-local storage, in user space

## Linux Threads

- Linux refers to them as tasks rather than threads
- `struct task_struct` points to process data structures (shared or unique) 
- Linux provides a **fork** system call with the traditional functionality of duplicating a process



- Thread creation is done through clone() system call. 
  - clone behaves much like fork, except that instead of creating a copy of the calling process, it creates a separate process that shares the address space of the calling process 
  - A cloned task behaves like a separate thread
  - clone() allows a child task to share the address space of the parent task (process) 
  - In case of clone, Sharing of address space is allowed because of 
    - Rather than storing kernel data for each process’s data structure, it stores pointers to data structures of other process
  - Linux refers to both of process and thread as tasks 
- Aside from the cloned process, Linux does not support multithreading, separate data structures. 
- Pthread implementations are available for user-level multithreading



<br>

## Linux Threads

- `fork()` and `clone()` system calls 
- Doesn’t distinguish between process and thread 
- Uses term task rather than thread 
- `clone()` takes options to determine sharing on process create  
- `struct task_struct` points to process data structures (shared or unique)
