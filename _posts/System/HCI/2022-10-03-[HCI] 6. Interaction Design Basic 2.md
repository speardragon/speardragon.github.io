## Think about dialogue

- What does it mean in UI design?

## Think about dialogue

- What does it mean in UI design?
- ![image-20221010140251485](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140251485.png)
  - marriage service
    - general flow, generic – blanks for names
    - pattern of interaction between people
  - computer dialogue
    - pattern of interaction between users and system
    - but details differ each time



<br>

## Network diagrams

![image-20221010140305392](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140305392.png)

- Show different paths through system



- What leads to what
- What happens when
- Including branches
- More task oriented then hierarchy



<br>

## Wider still

- Between applications
- And beyond ...



<br>

## Wider still …

- Style issues:
  - platform standards, consistency: Windows vs MacOS
- Functional issues
  - cut and paste: ^C & ^V
- Navigation issues
  - embedded applications
  - links to other apps … the web



<br>

## User action and control

- Entering information
- Knowing what to do
- Affordances



<br>

## Entering information

![image-20221010140405412](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140405412.png)

- Forms, dialogue boxes
  - presentation + data input
  - similar layout issues
  - alignment – NB: different label lengths
- Logical layout
  - use task analysis
  - groupings
  - natural order for entering information
    - top-bottom, left-right (depending on culture)
    - set tab order for keyboard entry



<br>

## Knowing what to do

- What is active, what is passive
  - where do you click
  - where do you type
- Consistent style helps
  - e.g. web underlined links
- Labels and icons
  - standards for common actions
  - language – bold = current state or action



<br>

## Affordances

![image-20221010140515453](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140515453.png)

- Psychological term
  - The perceived and actual properties of an object that determine how it could possibly be used
- For physical objects
  - shape and size suggest actions
    - pick up, twist, throw
  - also cultural – buttons ‘afford’ pushing 
- For screen objects
  - button-like object ‘affords’ mouse click
  - physical-like objects suggest use
- Culture of computer use
  - icons ‘afford’ clicking
  - or even double clicking … not like real buttons!



<br>

## Affordance Examples

![image-20221010140525545](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140525545.png)



<br>

## Affordances in GUI Design

- Buttons drawn as 3D shapes appear to “stick out” and hence afford pushing.
- Sliders and scroll bars afford dragging

<br>

## Tabbed Dialogs

![image-20221010140552240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140552240.png)



<br>

## Appropriate appearance

- Presenting information
- Aesthetics and utility
- Colour and 3D
- Localisation & internationalisation



<br>

## screen design and layout

- basic principles
- grouping, structure, order
- alignment
- use of white space

![image-20221010140625190](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140625190.png)



<br>

## basic principles

- ask
  - what is the user doing?
- think
  - what information, comparisons, order
- design
  - form follows function



<br>

## available tools

- grouping of items
- order of items 
- decoration - fonts, boxes etc.
- alignment of items
- white space between items



<br>

## grouping and structure

logically together => physically together

![image-20221010140708765](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140708765.png)



<br>

## order of groups and items

- think! - what is natural order
- should match screen order!
  - use boxes, space etc.
  - set up tabbing right!
- instructions
  - beware the cake recipe syndrome!

![image-20221010140731151](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140731151.png)



<br>

## decoration

- use boxes to group logical items
- use fonts for emphasis, headings
- but not too many!!

![image-20221010140744037](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140744037.png)



<br>

## alignment - text

- you read from left to right (English and European)
  ==> align left hand side

![image-20221010140759570](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140759570.png)



<br>

## alignment - names

- Usually scanning for surnames => make it easy!

![image-20221010140812763](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140812763.png)



<br>

## alignment - numbers

![image-20221010140820622](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140820622.png)



<br>

## alignment - numbers

<br>

## multiple columns

- scanning across gaps hard:
  (often hard to avoid with large data base fields)

![image-20221010140843084](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140843084.png)



<br>

## multiple columns - 2

- use leaders 

![image-20221010140853776](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140853776.png)



<br>

## multiple columns - 3

- or greying (vertical too)

![image-20221010140908660](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140908660.png)



<br>

## multiple columns - 4

- or even (with care!) ‘bad’ alignment

![image-20221010140922382](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140922382.png)



<br>

## white space - the counter

![image-20221010140929942](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140929942.png)





<br>

## space to separate

![image-20221010140937225](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140937225.png)

<br>

## space to highlight

![image-20221010140952234](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010140952234.png)
