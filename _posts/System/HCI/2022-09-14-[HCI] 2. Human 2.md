## Thinking

- Reasoning(추론) - 앞 뒤를 생각해서 이건 이렇게 될 것 같아! 처럼 추측하는 행위
  - deduction, induction, abduction 
- Problem solving - reasoning과는 달리 답이 없는 상태에서 답을 찾아내려고 하는 방식



<br>

## Deductive Reasoning

- Deduction(연역): If A, then B 
  - Derive logically necessary conclusion from given premises(전제). 
    - e.g. If it is Friday then she will go to work 
    - It is Friday 
    - Therefore she will go to work. 
  - Logical conclusion **not necessarily true**: 
    - e.g. If it is raining then the ground is dry 
    - It is raining 
    - Therefore the ground is dry

- 꼭 옳다는 것을 의미하는 것은 아님(잘못될 수도 있음)
  - 전제가 틀려있을 수도 있다.



<br>

## Deduction (cont.)

- When truth and logical validity clash … 

  - 조건이 불충분할 수 있다.
  - e.g. Some people are babies 
  - Some babies cry 
  - Inference(추론) - Some people cry 
  - some 때문에 전체적으로 맞는 경우가 아니라 부분적으로 맞는 경우가 된다.(불충분)

  Correct? 

- People bring world knowledge to bear



<br>

## Inductive Reasoning(귀납적 추론)

- Induction: **Generalizing** from previous cases to learn about new ones 
  - Generalize from cases seen to cases unseen 
    - case들을 모아 일반화시키는 방식
    - e.g. All elephants we have seen have trunks, therefore all elephants have trunks. 
- Unreliable: 
  - Can only prove false, not true – checking all elephants (?) 
  - 하나만 잘못된 것을 찾으면 바로 틀린 논제가 되어버림
    - 그래서 이를 증명하려면 모든 경우를 확인해야 함.
  - … but useful! 
    - 하지만 효율적임!
- **Humans not good at using negative evidence** 
  - e.g. Wason's cards.



<br>

## Wason's cards

> If a card has a vowel(모음) on one side, it has an even number on the other

Is this true? 

How many cards do you need to turn over to find out? 

…. and which cards?

- E를 뒤집으면 반드시 짝수가 있어야 하지만 4를 뒤집었을 땐 모음이 없어도 된다.(조건을 잘 읽으면...)
  - 그런데 사람들은 4뒤에는 모음이 있어야 된다고 착각

- 이것이 negative evidence!
- 조건문이 앞에 것이 뒤에 것을 보장하지만 뒤에 것이 앞에 것을 보장하지 않는다.

<br>

## Abductive Reasoning(가설 유도적 추론)

- Abduction: Reasoning from a **fact back to the action** or state that caused it 
  - Reasoning from event to cause 
    - e.g. Sam drives fast when drunk. 
    - If I see Sam driving fast, assume drunk. 
- **Unreliable**: 
  - Can lead to false explanations(가설이기 때문에)

정말 모르겠을 때 추론하는 방법

<br>

## Reasoning

- **Deductive reasoning** is valid 
  - Deductive inference guarantees if the premises are true so it the conclusion 
- Inductive and abductive reasoning are unreliable 
  - Cannot guarantee true conclusions even with true premises(전제) 
  - Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likely 
  - Abductive reasoning: taking your best shot 
- Deductive reasoning is limited to application of rules to examples 
- Inductive and abductive reasoning are important for generating hypotheses



<br>

## Reasoning (cont.)

- Humans rely on inductive and abductive inference, as well as deduction 
- Humans regulate inherent unreliability of these reasoning modes 
  - Using contextual knowledge 
  - Using belief revision 
- Computers rely primarily on deductive inference 
  - Although some AI techniques use induction and abduction

<br>

## Reasoning to Problem-Solving

- Where reasoning involves inference about a familiar problem domain 
- **Problem solving** refers to the ability to design solutions to problems in **unfamiliar problem domains** 
- Humans use at least three types of problem-solving techniques 
  - Heuristics (해 보고 판단하는 것)
  - Analogy(유추) and metaphor(비유) 
  - Learning



<br>

## Problem-Solving Techniques

- **Heuristics**: using informed trial and error based on rules of thumb 
  - 사람이 대충 정해서 하겠다.(사바사)
  - E.g. Chess openings (develop your pieces, gain control of the center of the board) 
  
- Analogy and metaphor: adapting solutions from one problem domain to another 
  - E.g **Object-orientation** (treating software modules as physical objects) 
- **Learning**: improving performance by **acquiring skills** over time with repeated exposure to a problem 
  - E.g. Multiply 1496 by 20



<br>

## How Problem-Solving works

- Process of finding solution to unfamiliar task using knowledge 
  - Storage in LTM, then application of knowledge 
- **Observation**: 
  - People are more **heuristic than algorithmic** - 사람들은 algorithmic보단 heuristic을 더 좋아함.
    - Try a few quick shots rather than plan because resources are simply not available
  - People often choose **suboptimal** strategies for **low priority** problems 
    - 우선순위가 낮다고 생각될 수록 대충함
  - People learn better strategies with practice 
    - 연습하면 더 좋아짐
- Several theories. 
  - Gestalt 
  - Problem Space Theory 
  - Analogy 
  - Skill Acquisition



<br>

## Gestalt Theory

- means "unified whole" 
- Problem solving both productive and reproductive 
- Productive draws on insight and restructuring of problem 
- Attractive but not enough evidence to explain **`insight'** etc. 
- Move away from behaviourism and led towards information processing theories 
- Principles: 
  - Similarity 
  - Continuation 
  - Closure 
  - Proximity (근처에 있는 것일수록)
  - Figure and Ground(foreground, background에 따라서)
- 전혀 상관없어 보이는 도형일지라도 모이면 무슨 의미인지 알 수 있다.

<br>

## Problem Space Theory

- **Problem space** comprises **problem states** 
  - 문제를 단계적으로 해석
  - state들을 내가 원하는 쪽으로 몰고 감.

- Problem-solving involves generating states using legal operators 
- Heuristics may be employed to select operators 
  - e.g. means-ends analysis 
  - 수단을 통해 목적을 달성하도록 하는 것
- Operates within human information processing system 
  - e.g. STM limits etc. 
  - short term memory가 관여
- Largely applied to problem-solving in well-defined areas 
  - e.g. puzzles rather than knowledge intensive areas

​	

<br>

## Other Problem Solving Issues

- Analogy 
  - Analogical mapping: 
    - Novel problems in new domain? 
    - Use knowledge of similar problem from similar domain 
  - Analogical mapping difficult if domains are semantically different 
- Skill Acquisition 
  - **Skilled activity** characterized by **chunking** 
  - Lot of information is chunked to optimize STM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  - Conceptual rather than superficial grouping of problems 
  - Information is structured more effectively

<br>

## Mental Models

- How do we understand how the world works? 
  - More than simple memory 
  - Includes expectations of behaviour 
- I throw a ball at my friend, and she catches it 
  - How did I know how hard to throw it? 
  - How did she know where to stand to catch it? 
- We have an understanding of the mechanics of the world 
  - How objects interact, the relationships between them



<br>

## What is a mental model?

- A cognitive structure that encodes how an aspect of the world operates 
- Includes information about which object classes interact with which other classes 
- Also includes information about how objects interact, and how interactions change properties 
- Malleable structures which are strengthened by successful application



<br>

## Mental model example

The circle is above and to the right of the square 

- We can ask questions about this situation 
  - Which object is to the left? 
  - Which object is at the bottom? 
  - Would the circle balance on the square? 
- By creating a mental model, these questions are simple to answer 
  - Add in knowledge we already have 
  - You can simply ‘see’ the answer



<br>

## How we use mental models

- We use mental models to generate predictions 
  - Predict where the ball will land 
- Expertise is generally associated with mental models closer to reality 
  - An expert cricket player understands ball physics better 
  - But mental models are always unconscious (‘knowing’ doesn’t help) 
- Mental models are not based on accurate physics 
  - Can lead to incorrect predictions 
  - Based on experience, etc.  
  - Change as they are used



<br>

## Expanding mental models

- HCI researchers have expanded the idea 
  - Includes a **user’s understanding** of the workings of a computing device 
  - Expectations of menu structures, where files are stored, etc. 
- In HCI understanding user’s mental models is important 
  - Understand **how learning a system works** 
  - Reduce **stress/workload** by supporting user’s mental models 
  - Tailor systems to fit how users perceive the system



<br>

## Mental models and user-interfaces

- Any interface requires a mental model to use 
  - What to expect when typing, clicking, etc 
  - How to interpret the consequences of actions (e.g. link new window with clicking of the icon) 
- Mental models are important when interface has little feedback 
  - Difficult to recognize results 
  - Few cues to evaluate the new state of the system 
  - Problems with impoverished devices



<br>

## Errors and Mental Models

- Types of Error 

  - Slips 

    - Right intention, but failed to do it right 

    - Causes: poor physical skill, inattention etc. 

    - Change to aspect of skilled behaviour can cause slip 
    
    - 잘못누른 것이기 때문에 설명으로 해결되지 않음

- Mistakes 
  - Wrong intention 
  - Cause: incorrect understanding 
    - humans create mental models to explain behaviour. 
    - if wrong (different from actual system) errors can occur
  - 처음부터 이해를 잘못한 것.



<br>

## Emotion

- Various theories of how emotion works 
  - James-Lange: emotion is our interpretation of a physiological response to a stimuli 
    - 자극에 대해서 신체적 반응이 나타내는 것
  - Cannon: emotion is a psychological response to a stimuli 
    - 심리적으로 나타나는 것
  - Schachter-Singer: emotion is the result of our evaluation of our physiological responses, in the light of the whole situation we are in 
    - 개가 짖으면 어떤 반응이 보여질 텐데 나중에 가서 '아 이게 공포였구나'를 느끼는 것이 감정이다.(?)
- **Emotion** clearly involves both cognitive and physical responses to **stimuli**

![image-20220909220704859](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909220704859.png)



<br>

## Emotion (cont.)

- The biological response to physical stimuli is called affect 
- Affect influences how we respond to situations 
  - positive -> creative problem-solving 
  - negative -> narrow thinking 
  - “Negative affect can make it harder to do even easy tasks; positive affect can make it easier to do difficult tasks” - Donald Norman

- Implications for interface design 
  - Stress will increase the difficulty of problem-solving 
  - Relaxed users will be more forgiving of shortcomings in design 
  - Aesthetically pleasing and rewarding interfaces will increase positive affect
    - interface의 효율 뿐 아니라 보기 좋은 것 -> positive affect를 주기 때문에



<br>

## Individual Differences

- Long term 
  - sex, physical and intellectual abilities 
- Short term 
  - effect of stress or fatigue(피로도; 지속적인) 
- Changing 
  - age

Ask yourself: 
will design decision exclude section of user population?



<br>

## Psychology vs. Design of Interactive System

- Some direct applications 
  - e.g. blue acuity is poor 
    - blue should not be used for important detail 
- 눈에 띄면서 자세한 걸 원하면 그린
- 눈에 확실히 띄게 하려면 레드
- 블루는 자세한 걸 나타날 때 맹점을 보임
- However, correct application generally requires **understanding of context in psychology**, and an understanding of **specific experimental conditions** 
- A lot of knowledge has been distilled in 
  - guidelines 
  - cognitive models 
  - experimental and analytic evaluation techniques
