## Thinking

- Reasoning 
  - deduction, induction, abduction 
- Problem solving



<br>

## Deductive Reasoning

- Deduction: If A, then B 
  - Derive logically necessary conclusion from given premises. 
    - e.g. If it is Friday then she will go to work 
    - It is Friday 
    - Therefore she will go to work. 
  - Logical conclusion not necessarily true: 
    - e.g. If it is raining then the ground is dry 
    - It is raining 
    - Therefore the ground is dry



<br>

## Deduction (cont.)

- When truth and logical validity clash … 

  - e.g. Some people are babies 
  - Some babies cry 
  - Inference - Some people cry 

  Correct? 

- People bring world knowledge to bear



<br>

## Inductive Reasoning

- Induction: Generalizing from previous cases to learn about new ones 
  - Generalize from cases seen to cases unseen 
    - e.g. All elephants we have seen have trunks, therefore all elephants have trunks. 
- Unreliable: 
  - Can only prove false, not true – checking all elephants (?) 
  - … but useful! 
- Humans not good at using negative evidence 
  - e.g. Wason's cards.

> If a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other

Is this true? 

How many cards do you need to turn over to find out? 

…. and which cards?



<br>

## Abductive Reasoning

- Abduction: Reasoning from a fact back to the action or state that caused it 
  - Reasoning from event to cause 
    - e.g. Sam drives fast when drunk. 
    - If I see Sam driving fast, assume drunk. 
- Unreliable: 
  - Can lead to false explanations



<br>

## Reasoning

- Deductive reasoning is valid 
  - Deductive inference guarantees if the premises are true so it the conclusion 
- Inductive and abductive reasoning are unreliable 
  - Cannot guarantee true conclusions even with true premises 
  - Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likely 
  - Abductive reasoning: taking your best shot 
- Deductive reasoning is limited to application of rules to examples 
- Inductive and abductive reasoning are important for generating hypotheses



<br>

## Reasoning (cont.)

- Humans rely on inductive and abductive inference, as well as deduction 
- Humans regulate inherent unreliability of these reasoning modes 
  - Using contextual knowledge 
  - Using belief revision 
- Computers rely primarily on deductive inference 
  - Although some AI techniques use induction and abduction

<br>

## Reasoning to Problem-Solving

- Where reasoning involves inference about a familiar problem domain 
  - Problem so	lving refers to the ability to design solutions to problems in unfamiliar problem domains 
- Humans use at least three types of problem-solving techniques 
  - Heuristics 
  - Analogy and metaphor 
  - Learning



<br>

## Problem-Solving Techniques

- Heuristics: using informed trial and error based on rules of thumb 
  - E.g. Chess openings (develop your pieces, gain control of the center of the board) 
- Analogy and metaphor: adapting solutions from one problem domain to another 
  - E.g Object-orientation (treating software modules as physical objects) 
- Learning: improving performance by acquiring skills over time with repeated exposure to a problem 
  - E.g. Multiply 1496 by 20



<br>

## How Problem-Solving works

- Process of finding solution to unfamiliar task using knowledge 
  - Storage in LTM, then application of knowledge 
- Observation: 
  - People are more heuristic than algorithmic 
    - Try a few quick shots rather than plan because resources are simply not available
  - People often choose suboptimal strategies for low priority problems 
  - People learn better strategies with practice 
- Several theories. 
  - Gestalt 
  - Problem Space Theory 
  - Analogy 
  - Skill Acquisition



<br>

## Gestalt Theory

- means "unified whole" 
- Problem solving both productive and reproductive 
- Productive draws on insight and restructuring of problem 
- Attractive but not enough evidence to explain `insight' etc. 
- Move away from behaviourism and led towards information processing theories 
- Principles: 
  - Similarity 
  - Continuation 
  - Closure 
  - Proximity 
  - Figure and Ground

<br>

## Problem Space Theory

- Problem space comprises problem states 
- Problem-solving involves generating states using legal operators  Heuristics may be employed to select operators 
  - e.g. means-ends analysis 
- Operates within human information processing system 
  - e.g. STM limits etc. 
- Largely applied to problem-solving in well-defined areas 
  - e.g. puzzles rather than knowledge intensive areas

​	

<br>

## Other Problem Solving Issues

- Analogy 
  - Analogical mapping: 
    - Novel problems in new domain? 
    - Use knowledge of similar problem from similar domain 
  - Analogical mapping difficult if domains are semantically different 
- Skill Acquisition 
  - Skilled activity characterized by chunking 
  - Lot of information is chunked to optimize STM 
  - Conceptual rather than superficial grouping of problems 
  - Information is structured more effectively



<br>

## Mental Models

- How do we understand how the world works? 
  - More than simple memory 
  - Includes expectations of behaviour 
- I throw a ball at my friend, and she catches it 
  - How did I know how hard to throw it? 
  - How did she know where to stand to catch it? 
- We have an understanding of the mechanics of the world 
  - How objects interact, the relationships between them



<br>

## What is a mental model?

- A cognitive structure that encodes how an aspect of the world operates 
- Includes information about which object classes interact with which other classes 
- Also includes information about how objects interact, and how interactions change properties 
- Malleable structures which are strengthened by successful application



<br>

## Mental model example

The circle is above and to the right of the square 

- We can ask questions about this situation 
  - Which object is to the left? 
  - Which object is at the bottom? 
  - Would the circle balance on the square? 
- By creating a mental model, these questions are simple to answer 
  - Add in knowledge we already have 
  - You can simply ‘see’ the answer



<br>

## How we use mental models

- We use mental models to generate predictions 
  - Predict where the ball will land 
- Expertise is generally associated with mental models closer to reality 
  - An expert cricket player understands ball physics better 
  - But mental models are always unconscious (‘knowing’ doesn’t help) 
- Mental models are not based on accurate physics 
  - Can lead to incorrect predictions 
  - Based on experience, etc.  
  - Change as they are used



<br>

## Expanding mental models

- HCI researchers have expanded the idea 
  - Includes a user’s understanding of the workings of a computing device 
  - Expectations of menu structures, where files are stored, etc. 
- In HCI understanding user’s mental models is important 
  - Understand how learning a system works 
  - Reduce stress/workload by supporting user’s mental models 
  - Tailor systems to fit how users perceive the system



<br>

## Mental models and user-interfaces

- Any interface requires a mental model to use 
  - What to expect when typing, clicking, etc 
  - How to interpret the consequences of actions (e.g. link new window with clicking of the icon) 
- Mental models are important when interface has little feedback 
  - Difficult to recognize results 
  - Few cues to evaluate the new state of the system 
  - Problems with impoverished devices



<br>

## Errors and Mental Models

- Types of Error 

  - Slips 

    - Right intention, but failed to do it right 

    - Causes: poor physical skill, inattention etc. 

    - Change to aspect of skilled behaviour can cause slip 

- Mistakes 
  - Wrong intention 
  - Cause: incorrect understanding 
    - humans create mental models to explain behaviour. 
    - if wrong (different from actual system) errors can occur



<br>

## Emotion

- Various theories of how emotion works 
  - James-Lange: emotion is our interpretation of a physiological response to a stimuli 
  - Cannon: emotion is a psychological response to a stimuli 
  - Schachter-Singer: emotion is the result of our evaluation of our physiological responses, in the light of the whole situation we are in 
- Emotion clearly involves both cognitive and physical responses to stimuli

![image-20220909220704859](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909220704859.png)



<br>

## Emotion (cont.)

- The biological response to physical stimuli is called affect 
- Affect influences how we respond to situations 
  - positive -> creative problem-solving 
  - negative -> narrow thinking 
  - “Negative affect can make it harder to do even easy tasks; positive affect can make it easier to do difficult tasks” - Donald Norman

- Implications for interface design 
  - Stress will increase the difficulty of problem-solving 
  - Relaxed users will be more forgiving of shortcomings in design 
  - Aesthetically pleasing and rewarding interfaces will increase positive affect



<br>

## Individual Differences

- Long term 
  - sex, physical and intellectual abilities 
- Short term 
  - effect of stress or fatigue 
- Changing 
  - age

Ask yourself: 
will design decision exclude section of user population?



<br>

## Psychology vs. Design of Interactive System

- Some direct applications 
  - e.g. blue acuity is poor 
    - blue should not be used for important detail 
- However, correct application generally requires understanding of context in psychology, and an understanding of specific experimental conditions 
- A lot of knowledge has been distilled in 
  - guidelines 
  - cognitive models 
  - experimental and analytic evaluation techniques
