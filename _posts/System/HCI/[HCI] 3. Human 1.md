## the human

- Information I/O … 
  - visual, auditory, haptic, movement 
- Information stored in memory 
  - sensory, short-term, long-term 
- Information processed and applied 
  - reasoning, problem solving, skill, error 
- Emotion influences human capabilities 
- Each person is different



<br>

## Vision

- Two stages in vision 
  - Physical reception of stimulus 
    - Eyes 
    - Ears 
    - Fingers 
  - Processing and interpretation of stimulus 
    - Perception 
    - Memory



<br>

## The Eye - physical reception

- Mechanism for receiving light and transforming it into electrical energy 
- Light reflects from objects 
- Images are focused upside-down on retina 
- Retina contains rods for low light vision and cones for colour vision 
- Ganglion cells (brain!) detect pattern and movement

<br>

## Interpreting the signal

- Size and depth 
  - Visual angle indicates how much of view object occupies (relates to size and distance from eye) 
  - Visual acuity is ability to perceive detail (limited)
  - Familiar objects perceived as constant size (in spite of changes in visual angle when far away) 
  - Cues like overlapping help perception of size and depth



<br>

## Interpreting the signal (cont)

- Brightness 
  - Subjective reaction to levels of light 
  - Affected by luminance of object 
  - Measured by just noticeable difference 
  - Visual acuity increases with luminance as does flicker 
- Color 
  - Made up of hue, intensity, saturation 
  - Cones sensitive to colour wavelengths 
  - Blue acuity is lowest 
  - 8% males and 1% females colour blind



- The visual system compensates for: 
  - Movement 
  - Changes in luminance. 
- Context is used to resolve ambiguity 
- Optical illusions sometimes occur due to overcompensation



<br>

## Optical Illusions

![image-20220909214055962](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214055962.png)



<br>

## Reading

- Several stages: 
  - Visual pattern perceived
  - Decoded using internal representation of language 
  - Interpreted using knowledge of syntax, semantics, pragmatics 
- Reading involves saccades and fixations 
- Perception occurs during fixations 
- Word shape is important to recognition 
- Negative contrast improves reading from computer screen



<br>

## Hearing

- Provides information about environment: distances, directions, objects etc. 
- Physical apparatus: 
  - Outer ear: protects inner and amplifies sound 
  - Middle ear: transmits sound waves as vibrations to inner ear 
  - Inner ear: chemical transmitters are released and cause impulses in auditory nerve 
- Sound 
  - Pitch: sound frequency 
  - Loudness: amplitude 
  - Timbre: type or quality

![image-20220909214208968](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214208968.png)



- Humans can hear frequencies from 20Hz to 15kHz 
  - Less accurate distinguishing high frequencies than low. 
- Auditory system filters sounds 
  - Can attend to sounds over background noise. 
  - For example, the cocktail party phenomenon.



<br>

## Touch

- Provides important feedback about environment. 
- May be key sense for someone who is visually impaired. 
- Stimulus received via receptors in the skin: 
  - Thermoreceptors: heat and cold 
  - Nociceptors: pain 
  - Mechanoreceptors: pressure (some instant, some continuous) 
- Some areas more sensitive than others e.g. fingers. 
- Kinesthesis - awareness of body position 
- Affects comfort and performance.



<br>

## Movement

- Time taken to respond to stimulus: reaction time + movement time  Movement time dependent on age, fitness etc. 
- Reaction time - dependent on stimulus type: 
  - visual ~ 200ms 
  - auditory ~ 150 ms 
  - pain ~ 700ms 
- Increasing reaction time decreases accuracy in the unskilled operator but not in the skilled operator.



<br>

## Movement (cont)

- Fitts' Law describes the time taken to hit a screen target 
  - Shannon formulation (Dr. Scott MacKenzie)

- where: 
  - a and b are empirically determined constants 
  - Mt is movement time 
  - D is Distance 
  - W is Width of target

>targets as large as possible distances as small as possible

<br>

## Memory

- There are three types of memory function:

![image-20220909214441994](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214441994.png)

- Selection of stimuli governed by level of arousal.



<br>

## Sensory Memory

- Buffers for stimuli received through senses 
  - Iconic memory: visual stimuli 
  - Echoic memory: aural stimuli 
  - Haptic memory: tactile stimuli 
- Examples 
  - Sparkler trail 
  - Someone else’s name called in public 
- Continuously overwritten

![image-20220909214522817](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214522817.png)

<br>

## Short-term Memory (STM)

- Scratch-pad for temporary recall 
  - Rapid access ~ 70ms 
  - Rapid decay ~ 20s to 30s 
  - Limited capacity – 7 ± 2 chunks



<br>

## Examples

212348278493202 

0121 414 2626 

HEC ATR ANU PTH ETR EET



<br>

## Long-term Memory (LTM)

- Repository for all our knowledge 
  - Slow access ~ 1 to 10 seconds 
  - Slow decay, if any 
  - Huge or unlimited capacity 
- Two types 
  - Explicit memories are declarative memories, include all of the memories that are available in consciousness 
  - Episodic memory & Semantic memory 
  - Implicit memories are those that are mostly unconscious 
  - Procedural memory & Emotional memory



<br>

## Long-term Memory (cont.)

- Explicit memories 
  - Episodic: serial memory of events 
  - Semantic: structured memory of facts, concepts, skills 
  - Semantic LTM derived from episodic LTM 
- Implicit memories 
  - Procedural: the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil or ride a bicycle 
  - Emotional: the memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion



- Semantic memory structure 
  - Provides access to information 
  - Represents relationships between bits of information 
  - Supports inference 
- Model: Semantic Network 
  - Inheritance – child nodes inherit properties of parent nodes 
  - Explicit relationships between bits of information 
  - Supports inference through inheritance



<br>

## LTM - Semantic Network

![image-20220909214748129](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214748129.png)



<br>

## Models of LTM - Frames

- Information organized in data structures 
- Slots in structure instantiated with values for instance of data 
- Type–subtype relationships

![image-20220909214813922](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214813922.png)



<br>

## Models of LTM - Scripts

- Model of stereotypical information required to interpret situation 
- Script has elements that can be instantiated with values for context

![image-20220909214834542](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214834542.png)



<br>

## Models of LTM - Production Rules

- Representation of procedural knowledge. 
- Condition/action rules 
  - if condition is matched 
  - then use rule to determine action

![image-20220909214906571](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214906571.png)



<br>

## LTM - Storage of information

- Rehearsal 
  - Information moves from STM to LTM 
- Total time hypothesis 
  - Amount retained proportional to rehearsal time 
- Distribution of practice effect 
  - Optimized by spreading learning over time 
- Structure, meaning and familiarity 
  - Information easier to remember



<br>

## LTM - Forgetting

- Decay 
  - Information is lost gradually but very slowly 
- Interference 
  - New information replaces old: retroactive interference 
  - Old may interfere with new: proactive inhibition 
- So may not forget at all memory is selective … 
- Affected by emotion 
  - Can subconsciously ‘choose’ to forget



<br>

## LTM - Retrieval

- Recall 
  - Information reproduced from memory can be assisted by cues, e.g. categories, imagery 
- Recognition 
  - Information gives knowledge that it has been seen before 
  - Less complex than recall - information is cue
