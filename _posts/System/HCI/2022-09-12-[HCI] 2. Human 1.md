## the human

- Information I/O … 
  - visual, auditory, haptic, movement 
- Information stored in **memory** 
  - sensory, short-term, long-term 
- Information processed and applied 
  - reasoning, problem solving, skill, error 
- Emotion influences human capabilities 
- Each person is different



<br>

## Vision

- Two stages in vision 
  - Physical reception of stimulus (입력을 받아들이는 감각)
    - Eyes 
    - Ears 
    - Fingers 
  - Processing and interpretation of stimulus (카메라로 사진을 찍고 나서의 처리과정과 같은 과정)
    - Perception 
    - Memory



<br>

## The Eye - physical reception

- Mechanism for **receiving light** and transforming it into **electrical energy** 
- Light reflects from objects 
- Images are focused **upside-down on retina** 
- Retina contains rods(모든 종류의 파장이 가능해서 강조를 파악) for low light vision and cones(특정 주파수를 통해 wavelength에 의해서 가능한 cell) for colour vision 
- Ganglion cells (brain!) detect pattern and movement

<br>

## Interpreting the signal

- **Size and depth** 
  - Visual angle indicates how much of view object occupies (relates to size and **distance** from eye) 
  - Visual acuity is ability to perceive detail (limited)
  - Familiar objects perceived as constant size (in spite of changes in visual angle when far away) 
    - 책상을 예로 우리의 시각에서는 사다리꼴처럼 보이지만 뇌에서는 이를 직사각형으로 인식하거나 아무리 멀리 있어도 그 크기를 가늠할 수 있는 것이다.
  - Cues like **overlapping** help perception of size and depth



<br>

## Interpreting the signal (cont)

- Brightness 
  - Subjective reaction to levels of light 
  - Affected by luminance of object 
  - Measured by just noticeable difference 
  - Visual acuity increases with luminance as does flicker(깜빡깜빡) 
- Color 
  - Made up of hue, intensity, saturation 
  - Cones sensitive to colour wavelengths 
  - Blue acuity is lowest (파란색의 명암이 구분이 제일 힘듬; 그린 > 레드 > 블루)
    - acuity: 명확히 보고 듣고 생각하는 능력
  - 8% males and 1% females colour blind



- The visual system compensates for: 
  - Movement 
  - Changes in luminance. 
- Context is used to resolve ambiguity 
- Optical illusions(왜곡) sometimes occur due to overcompensation



<br>

## Optical Illusions

![image-20220909214055962](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214055962.png)



<br>

## Reading

- Several stages: 
  - Visual pattern perceived
  - Decoded using internal representation of language 
  - Interpreted using knowledge of syntax(문법), semantics(의미), pragmatics(맥락)
- Reading involves saccades(홱 스킵하면서 읽는) and fixations(가만히 있는) 
- Perception occurs during fixations 
- Word shape is important to recognition 
- Negative contrast improves reading from computer screen



<br>

## Hearing

- Provides information about environment: **distances**, **directions**, **objects** etc. 
- Physical apparatus: 
  - Outer ear: protects inner and amplifies sound 
  - Middle ear: transmits sound waves as vibrations to inner ear 
  - Inner ear: chemical transmitters are released and cause impulses in auditory nerve 
- Sound 
  - Pitch: sound frequency (높낮이)
  - Loudness: amplitude (크기)
  - Timbre: type or quality (음색)

![image-20220914093741301](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220914093741301.png)



- Humans can hear frequencies from 20Hz to 15kHz 
  - Less accurate distinguishing high frequencies than low. 
- Auditory system filters sounds 
  - Can attend to sounds over background noise. 
  - For example, the cocktail party phenomenon(웅성웅성하고 시끄러운 상황에서 대화를 하고 있는 상대의 말소리만 catch하는 능력).



<br>

## Touch

- Provides important feedback about environment. 
- May be key sense for someone who is visually impaired. 
- Stimulus received via receptors in the skin: 
  - Thermoreceptors: heat and cold 
  - Nociceptors: pain 
  - Mechanoreceptors: pressure (some instant, some continuous) 
- Some areas more sensitive than others e.g. fingers. 
- Kinesthesis - awareness of body position 
  - 눈을 감고도 내가 어떤 자세를 취하고 있는지를 인식하고 있는 것.

- Affects comfort and performance.



<br>

## Movement

- Time taken to respond to stimulus: 
  - reaction time + movement time 
- Movement time dependent on age, fitness etc. 
- Reaction time - dependent on stimulus type: 
  - visual ~ 200ms 
  - auditory ~ 150 ms 
  - pain ~ 700ms 
- Increasing reaction time decreases accuracy in the unskilled operator but not in the skilled operator.



<br>

## Movement (cont)

- **Fitts' Law** describes the time taken to hit a screen target 
  - Shannon formulation (Dr. Scott MacKenzie)

- where: 
  - a and b are empirically determined constants 
  - Mt is movement time 
  - D is Distance 
  - W is Width of target

>targets as large as possible distances as small as possible

<br>

## Memory

- There are three types of memory function:

![image-20220909214441994](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214441994.png)

- Selection of stimuli governed by level of arousal.



<br>

## Sensory Memory

- Buffers for stimuli received through senses 
  - Iconic memory: visual stimuli 
  - Echoic memory: aural stimuli 
  - Haptic memory: tactile stimuli 
- Examples 
  - Sparkler trail 
  - Someone else’s name called in public 
- Continuously overwritten

![image-20220909214522817](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214522817.png)

<br>

## Short-term Memory (STM)

- Scratch-pad for temporary recall 
  - Rapid access ~ 70ms 
  - Rapid decay ~ 20s to 30s 
  - Limited capacity – 7 ± 2 chunks



<br>

## Examples

212348278493202 

0121 414 2626 

HEC ATR ANU PTH ETR EET



<br>

## Long-term Memory (LTM)

- Repository for all our knowledge 
  - Slow access ~ 1 to 10 seconds 
  - Slow decay, if any (사라지지 않을지도 모름)
    - 연구 중에는 실제로 사라지지 않지만 해당 기억과 연결하는 시냅스가 끊어져서 기억이 안 나는 것일 수도 있다.
  - Huge or unlimited capacity 
- Two types 
  - Explicit memories are declarative memories, include all of the memories that are available in consciousness 
    - Episodic memory & Semantic memory 
  - Implicit memories are those that are mostly unconscious 
    - Procedural memory & Emotional memory
    - 의식적으로 기억하지 않는, 글씨 쓸 때 펜을 어떻게 잡고 있고 어떻게 쓰고 있는지 생각 안 하는 것처럼



<br>

## Long-term Memory (cont.)

- Explicit memories 
  - Episodic: serial memory of events (일어났던 사건을 기억하는)
  - Semantic: structured memory of facts, concepts, skills (역할을 기억하는)
  - Semantic LTM derived from episodic LTM 
- Implicit memories 
  - **Procedural**: the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil or ride a bicycle 
  - **Emotional**: the memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion



- Semantic memory structure 
  - Provides access to information 
  - Represents relationships between bits of information 
  - Supports inference 
- Model: Semantic Network 
  - Inheritance – child nodes inherit properties of parent nodes 
  - Explicit relationships between bits of information 
  - Supports inference through inheritance



<br>

## LTM - Semantic Network

![image-20220909214748129](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214748129.png)



<br>

## Models of LTM - Frames

- Information organized in data structures 
- Slots in structure instantiated with values for instance of data 
- Type–subtype relationships

![image-20220909214813922](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214813922.png)



<br>

## Models of LTM - Scripts

- Model of stereotypical information required to interpret situation 
- Script has elements that can be instantiated with values for context
- 수의사를 만나러 가는 스크립트

![image-20220909214834542](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214834542.png)



<br>

## Models of LTM - Production Rules

- Representation of procedural knowledge. 
- Condition/action rules 
  - if condition is matched 
  - then use rule to determine action

![image-20220909214906571](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909214906571.png)



<br>

## LTM - Storage of information

- Rehearsal 
  - Information moves from STM to LTM 
- Total time hypothesis 
  - Amount retained proportional to rehearsal time 
- Distribution of practice effect 
  - Optimized by spreading learning over time 
- Structure, meaning and familiarity 
  - Information easier to remember



<br>

## LTM - Forgetting

- Decay 
  - Information is lost gradually but very slowly 
- Interference 
  - New information replaces old: retroactive interference 
  - Old may interfere with new: proactive inhibition 
- So may not forget at all memory is selective … 
- Affected by emotion 
  - Can subconsciously ‘choose’ to forget



<br>

## LTM - Retrieval

- Recall 
  - Information reproduced from memory can be assisted by cues, e.g. categories, imagery 
- Recognition 
  - Information gives knowledge that it has been seen before 
  - Less complex than recall - information is **cue***(recall과의 차이)
