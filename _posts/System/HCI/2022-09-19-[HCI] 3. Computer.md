## The Computer

- a computer system is made up of various elements 
- each of these elements affects the interaction 
  - input devices – text entry and pointing 
  - output devices – screen (small&large), digital paper 
  - virtual reality – special interaction and display devices 
  - physical interaction – e.g. sound, haptic, bio-sensing 
  - paper – as output (print) and input (scan) 
  - memory – RAM & permanent media, capacity & access 
  - processing – speed of processing, networks



<br>

## Interacting with computers

to understand human–computer interaction … need to understand computers!

![image-20220909221050687](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221050687.png)



<br>

## A 'typical' computer system

- screen, or monitor, on which there are windows 
- keyboard 
- mouse/trackpad ![image-20220919121321481](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220919121321481.png)



- variations 
  - desktop 
  - laptop 
  - tablet 
- the devices dictate the styles of interaction that the system supports 
- If we use different devices, then the interface will support a different style of interaction



<br>

## How many computers ...

- in your house?

  - PC 
  - TV, VCR, DVD, HiFi, cable/satellite TV 
  - microwave, cooker, washing machine 
  - central heating 
  - security system 

  -> can you think of more?

- in your pockets? 

  - tablet 
  - phone, camera 
  - smart card, card with magnetic strip? 
  - electronic car key 
  - USB memory 

  -> try your pockets and bags



<br>

## Interactivity?

- Long ago in a galaxy far away … batch processing 
  - punched card stacks or large data files prepared 
  - long wait …. 
  - line printer output 
  - … and if it is not right … 
- Now most computing is interactive  
  - rapid feedback 
  - the user in control (most of the time) 
  - doing rather than thinking … 
- Is faster always better?



<br>

## text entry devices: Keyboards

- Most common text input device 
- Allows rapid entry of text by experienced users 
- Keypress closes circuit connection, causing a character code to be sent 
- Usually connected by cable, but can be wireless



<br>

## Layout - QWERTY

- Standardised layout 
- but … 
  - non-alphanumeric keys are placed differently 
  - accented symbols needed for different scripts 
  - minor differences between UK and USA keyboards 
- QWERTY arrangement not optimal for typing 
  - layout to prevent typewriters jamming! (그래서 많이쓰고 연속되는 키가 바로 옆에 있지 않다.)
- Alternative designs allow faster typing but large social base of QWERTY typists produces reluctance to change.

![image-20220909221454692](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221454692.png)



<br>

## Alternative keyboard layouts

- Alphabetic 
  - keys arranged in alphabetic order 
  - not faster for trained typists 
  - not faster for beginners either! 
- Dvorak 
  - common letters under dominant fingers 
  - biased towards right hand 
  - common combinations of letters alternate between hands 
  - 10-15% improvement in speed and reduction in fatigue 
  - But - large social base of QWERTY typists produce market pressures not to change



<br>

## Special keyboard

![image-20220909221607087](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221607087.png)

- One-handed keyboard 
  - designs to reduce fatigue for RSI 
  - e.g. the Maltron left-handed keyboard

<br>

![image-20220909221619732](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221619732.png)

- Chord keyboard 
  - letters typed as combination of keys pressed simultaneously 
  - BUT - social resistance, plus fatigue after extended use 
  - NEW – niche market for some wearables



<br>

## Phone pad and T9 entry

![image-20220909221648373](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221648373.png)

- use numeric keys with multiple presses

![image-20220909221659462](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221659462.png)

- hello = 4433555[pause]555666 
- surprisingly fast!

<br>

![image-20220909221719369](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909221719369.png)

- T9 predictive entry 
  - type as if single key for each letter 
  - use dictionary to ‘guess’ the right word 
  - hello = 43556 … 
  - but 26 -> menu ‘am’ or ‘an’



<br>

## Handwriting recognition

- Text can be input into the computer, using a pen and a digitizing tablet 
  - natural interaction 
- Technical problems: 
  - capturing all useful information - stroke path, pressure, etc. in a natural manner 
  - segmenting joined up writing into individual letters 
  - interpreting individual letters 
  - coping with different styles of handwriting 
- Used in smartphones, and tablet computers … … leave the keyboard on the desk! 



<br>

## Speech recognition

- Improving rapidly 
- Most successful when: 
  - single user – initial training and learns peculiarities 
  - limited vocabulary systems 
- Problems with 
  - external noise interfering 
  - imprecision of pronunciation 
  - large vocabularies 
  - different speakers



<br>

## Scanners

- Take paper and convert it into a bitmap 
- Two sorts of scanner 
  - flat-bed: paper placed on a glass plate; whole page converted into bitmap  
  - hand-held: scanner passed over paper, digitising strip typically 3-4” wide. some camera apps do the same. 
- Shines light at paper and note intensity of reflection 
  - colour or greyscale 
- Typical resolutions from 600–2400 dpi



<br>

## Optical character recognition

- OCR converts bitmap back into text 
- different fonts 
  - create problems for simple “template matching” algorithms 
  - more complex systems segment text, decompose it into lines and arcs, and decipher characters that way 
- page format 
  - columns, pictures, headers and footers 



<br>

## Positioning, pointing and drawing: the Mouse

![image-20220909222026683](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222026683.png)

- Handheld pointing device 
  - very common & easy to use 
- Two characteristics 
  - planar movement 
  - Buttons : usually from 1 to 3 buttons on top, used for making a selection, indicating an option, or to initiate drawing etc. 
- Relative movement only is detectable. 
- Movement of mouse moves screen cursor 
- … an indirect manipulation device. 
  - device itself doesn’t obscure screen, is accurate and fast. 
  - hand-eye coordination problems for novice users



<br>

## Trackball and thumbwheels

![image-20220909222120750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222120750.png)

- Touchpad 
  - small touch sensitive tablets 
  - ‘stroke’ to move mouse pointer 
  - used mainly in laptop computers 
- Trackball 
  - ball is rotated inside static housing 
  - like an upside-down mouse! 
  - relative motion moves cursor 
  - indirect device, fairly accurate 
  - separate buttons for picking 
  - very fast for gaming 
  - used in some portable and notebook computers. 
- Thumbwheels … 
  - for accurate CAD – two dials for X-Y cursor position 
  - for fast scrolling – single dial on mouse



<br>

## Joystick and Pointing Stick

![image-20220909222205235](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222205235.png)

- Joystick 

  - indirect 

    pressure of stick = velocity of movement 

  - buttons for selection

    on top or on front like a trigger 

  - often used for computer games

    aircraft controls and 3D navigation

<br>

![image-20220909222217448](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222217448.png)

- Pointing Stick 
  - for laptop computers

<br>

## Digitizing tablet

![image-20220909222247069](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222247069.png)

- Mouse like-device with cross hairs 
- used on special surface 
  - rather like stylus 
- very accurate 
  - used for digitizing maps



<br>

## Touch screen

- Detect the presence of finger or stylus on the screen. 
  - works by interrupting matrix of light beams, capacitance changes or ultrasonic reflections 
  - direct pointing device 
- Advantages: 
  - fast, and requires no specialised pointer 
  - good for menu selection 
  - suitable for use in hostile environment: clean and safe from damage. 
- Disadvantages: 
  - finger can mark screen 
  - imprecise (finger is a fairly blunt instrument!) 
    - difficult to select small regions or perform accurate drawing 
  - lifting arm can be tiring



<br>

## Eyegaze

- Control interface by eye gaze direction 
  - e.g. look at a menu item to select it 
- Uses IR laser reflected off retina 
  - … a very low power laser! 
- Mainly used for evaluation 
- Potential for hands-free control 
- High accuracy requires headset 
- Cheaper and lower accuracy devices available 
- Sit under the screen like a small webcam

![image-20220909222403698](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222403698.png)

<br>

## Display devices: Resolution and colour depth

- Resolution … used (inconsistently) for 
  - number of pixels on screen (width x height) 
    - e.g. SVGA 1024 x 768, Full HD 1920 x 1080 
  - density of pixels (in pixels or dots per inch - dpi) 
    - typically between 72 and 96 dpi, for retina 200 to 400 dpi 
- Aspect ratio 
  - ration between width and height 
  - 4:3 for computer screens, 16:9 for wide-screen TV 
- Colour depth: 
  - how many different colours for each pixel? 
  - black/white or greys only 
  - 256 from a palette 
  - 8 bits each for red/green/blue = millions of colours



<br>

## Cathode ray tube(CRT)

- Stream of electrons emitted from electron gun, focused and directed by magnetic fields, hit phosphor-coated screen which glows 
- used in TVs and computer monitors

![image-20220909222523023](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222523023.png)

<br>

## Liquid crystal displays (LCD)

- Smaller, lighter, and … no radiation problems. 
- Found on phones, portables and notebooks, … and increasingly on desktop and for home TV 
- also used in dedicated displays: digital watches, mobile phones, HiFi controls 
- How it works … 
  - Top plate transparent and polarised, bottom plate reflecting or transparent. 
  - Voltage applied to crystal changes polarisation(편광) and hence colour 
  - Light reflected not emitted => less eye strain 
  - For a device with an internal light source has a backlight



<br>

## LCD Operating Principle

![image-20220909222628763](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222628763.png)

- Online 
  - Surrounding light is polarized on the upper plate. 
  - Molecules and lights are parallel to the lower analyzer. 
  - Light passes through the plate. 
- Offline 
  - Surrounding light is polarized on the upper plate. 
  - Molecules and lights are perpendicular to the lower analyzer. 
  - Light cannot pass through the plate.



<br>

## Digital paper

- what? 
  - thin flexible sheets 
  - updated electronically 
  - but retain display 
- how? 
  - small spheres turned 
  - or channels with **coloured** liquid and contrasting spheres 
  - or move up and down B/W microballs (e-ink) 
    - 소비전력이 낮음
  - rapidly developing area

![image-20220909222703633](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222703633.png)

<br>

## Virtual reality and 3D interaction: 3D displays

- Desktop VR  
  - Ordinary screen, mouse or keyboard control 
  - Perspective and motion give 3D effect 
- Seeing in 3D 
  - Use stereoscopic vision  
  - VR helmets 
  - Screen plus shuttered specs, etc

![image-20220909222750595](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222750595.png)

<br>

## VR motion sickness

- Time delay 
  - move head … lag … display moves 
  - conflict: head movement vs. eyes 
- Depth perception 
  - headset gives different stereo distance 
  - but all focused in same plane 
  - conflict: eye angle vs. focus 
- Conflicting cues => sickness
  - helps motivate improvements in technology



<br>

## Simulators and VR caves

- Scenes projected on walls 
- Realistic environment 
- Hydraulic rams! 
- Real controls 
- Other people

![image-20220909222845514](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222845514.png)

<br>

## Dedicated displays

- Analogue representations: 
  - dials, gauges, lights, etc. 
- Digital displays: 
  - small LCD screens, LED lights, etc. 
- Head-up displays (HUD) 
  - found in aircraft cockpits or automobiles 
  - show most important controls … depending on context 
- Hologram 
  - Gatebox animated robot

![image-20220909222923428](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20220909222923428.png)



<br>

## Printing

- image made from small dots 
  - allows any character set or graphic to be printed, 
- critical features: 
  - resolution 
    - size and spacing of the dots 
    - measured in dots per inch (dpi) 
  - speed 
    - usually measured in pages per minute 
  - cost!!



<br>

## Types of dot-based printers

- dot-matrix printers (가끔 영수증 뽑는 데서 보임)
  - use inked ribbon (like a typewriter)
  - line of pins that can strike the ribbon, dotting the paper. 
  - typical resolution 80-120 dpi 
- ink-jet and bubble-jet printers 
  - tiny blobs of ink sent from print head to paper 
  - typically 300 dpi or better . 
- laser printer 
  - like photocopier: dots of electrostatic charge deposited on drum, which picks up toner (black powder form of ink) rolled onto paper which is then fixed with heat 
  - typically 600 dpi or better.



<br>

## Processing and networks: Finite processing speed

- Designers tend to assume fast processors, and make interfaces more and more complicated 
- But problems occur, because processing cannot keep up with all the tasks it needs to do 
  - cursor overshooting because system has buffered keypresses 
  - icon wars - user clicks on icon, nothing happens, clicks on another, then system responds and windows fly everywhere 
- **Also problems if system is too fast** 
  - e.g. help screens may scroll through text much too rapidly to be read

​	

<br>

## Moore's law

- computers get faster and faster! 
- 1965 … 
  - Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, noticed a pattern 
  - processor speed doubles every 18 months 
  - PC … 1987: 1.5 Mhz, 2002: 1.5 GHz 
- similar pattern for memory 
  - but doubles every 12 months!! 
  - hard disk … 1991: 20Mbyte : 2002: 30 Gbyte 
- baby born today 
  - record all sound and vision 
  - by 70 all life’s memories stored in a grain of dust!



<br>

## The myth of the infinitely fast machine

- implicit assumption … no delays 
  - an infinitely fast machine 
- what is good design for real machines? 
- good example … the telephone : 
  - type keys too fast 
  - hear tones as numbers sent down the line 
  - actually an accident of implementation 
  - emulate in design



<br>

## Limitations on interactive performance

bottleneck

- Computation bound 
  - Computation takes ages, causing frustration for the user 
- Storage channel bound 
  - Bottleneck in transference of data from disk to memory 
- Graphics bound 
  - Common bottleneck: updating displays requires a lot of effort sometimes helped by adding a graphics coprocessor optimised to take on the burden 
- Network capacity 
  - Many computers networked – shared resources and files, access to printers etc. – but interactive performance can be reduced by slow network speed



<br>

## Networked computing

- Networks allow access to … 
  - large memory and processing 
  - other people (groupware, email) 
  - shared resources – esp. the web 
- Issues 
  - network delays – slow feedback 
  - conflicts – many people update data 
  - unpredictability



<br>

## The internet

- history … 
  - 1969: DARPANET US DoD, 4 sites 
  - 1971: 23; 1984: 1000; 1989: 10000 
- common language (protocols): 
  - TCP – Transmission Control protocol 
    - lower level, packets (like letters) between machines 
  - IP – Internet Protocol 
    - reliable channel (like phone call) between programs on machines 
  - email, HTTP, all build on top of these
