- Roadmap

![image-20221010142539478](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142539478.png)



<br>

## HCI Methodology

- System Development Methodology: 

  

  a standardized development process that defines 
  **a set of activities,** 
  **methods and techniques,** 
  **best practices,** 
  **deliverables,** 
  **and automated tools**
  that systems developers and project managers are to use to develop and continuously improve information systems



<br>

## The Role of HCI Development in SDLC

- System Development Philosophy:
follow formal scientific and engineering practice, yet 
make room for a strong creative element. 
- The general principles of user-centered systems 
development include 
- (1) involving users as much as possible 
- (2) integrating knowledge and expertise from different 
  disciplines 
- (3) encouraging high interactivity



<br>

## The Role of HCI Development in SDLC

- Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC):a commonly used methodology for information systems development that breaks the whole systems development process into manageable phases.

<br>

## The Role of HCI Development in SDLC

- Iteration through each of the phases and back to the previous phases is key to creating successful systems. Figure below illustrates the importance of iteration.

<br>

## The Human-Centred SDLC Model: HCSDLC

- HCSDLC:
a human centered systems development methodology where organizational needs and human needs are considered together throughout the systems development life cycle. 
- The next slide depicts the HCSDLC. The left side (a) is a typical SDLC model while the right side (b) is the HCSDLC model that covers both SA&D (System Analysis & Design) and HCI concerns and activities

<br>

## The Project Selection and Planning Phase

- Project selection and planning:
  - the first phase in SDLC where an organization’s total information systems needs are analyzed and arranged, a potential information systems project is identified, and an argument for continuing or not continuing with the project is presented.



<br>

## The Project Selection and Planning Phase

- One important activity during project planning is to assess project feasibility. This is also called a feasibility study. Most feasibility factors fall into the following six categories:
- Economic or cost-benefit analysis
- Operational
- Technical
- Schedule
- Legal and contractual
- Political



<br>

## The Interaction Analysis Phase

- Analysis: studies the current system and proposes alternative systems. 
- From the HCI perspective, requirement determination is still one of the most important activities, and alternative generation and selection are also necessary before subsequent design is conducted.
- In addition, HCI analysis includes user-acceptance tests on the system requirements



<br>

## Requirement Determination and User-Acceptance Test

- **User acceptance test**:
  - a test during the analysis stage using simple mockups to test the likelihood of the system’s functionalities being accepted by its potential users. 



<br>

## Requirement Determination and User-Acceptance Test

<br>

## Context Analysis

- Context analysis includes understanding the technical, environmental and social settings where the information systems will be used.
- There are four aspects in Context Analysis: 
  - physical context, 
  - technical context, 
  - organizational context, and 
  - social and cultural context.

- Physical context: 
  - Where are the tasks carried out? 
  - What entities and resources are implicated in task operation?
  - What physical structures and entities are necessary to understand observed task action? 

- Technical context: 
  - What are the technology infrastructure, platforms, hardware andsystem software, network/wireless connections? 
  - For example, an E-commerce website may be designed to only allow people with certain browser versions to access. The website may also be designed to allow small screen devices such as PDAs or mobile phones access.

- Organizational context: 
- What is the larger system into which this information system is embedded? 
- What are the interactions with other entities in the organization? 
- What are the organizational policies or practices that may affect the individual’s attitude and behavior towards using the system? 

- Social and cultural context: 
  - What are the social or cultural factors that may affect user attitudes and eventual use of the information system? 
  - Any information system is always part of a larger social system.



<br>

## User Analysis

- User Analysis:identifies the target users of the system and their characteristics. 
  - Demographic data
  - Traits and intelligence
  - Job or task related factors


<br>

## Task analysis

- Task Analysis:studies what and how users think and feel when they do things to achieve their goals. 
- Possible points of analysis in task analysis
  - User goals and use cases 
  - Cognitive, affective, and behaviouralanalysis of user tasks 
  - Workflow analysis 
  - General work distribution between users and the website/machine ![image-20221010143203606](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010143203606.png)

<br>

## Evaluation Metrics

- Evaluation Metrics:specifies the expected humancomputerinteraction goals of the system being designed. There are four types of HCI goals.

![image-20221010143219218](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010143219218.png)



<br>

## Alternative Generation and Selection

- Although SA&D emphasizes functionality in selecting design strategies, the approach of generating and selecting best alternatives can also be applied to HCI design strategies. The deliverables include 
  - (1) three substantially different design strategies (low, middle, and high range) 
  - (2) a design strategy judged most likely to lead to the most desirable system



<br>

## The Interaction Design Phase

- Design:to create or construct the system according to the analysis results. 
- Interface specification includes semantic understanding of the information needs to support HCI analysis results, and syntactical and lexical decisions including metaphor, media, dialogue, and presentation designs.



<br>

## The Interaction Design Phase

- Metaphor and visualization design helpsthe user develop a mental model of the system. 
  - It is concerned with finding or inventing metaphors or analogies that are appropriate for users to understand the entire system or part of it. 
  - There are well accepted metaphors for certain tasks, such as a shopping cart for holding items beforechecking out in the ECommercecontext, and light bulbs for online help or daily tips in productivity software packages. 



<br>

## The Interaction Design Phase

- Media design is concerned with selecting appropriate media types for meeting the specific information presentation needs and human experience needs. 
  - Popular media types include text, static images (e.g., painting, drawing or photos), dynamic images (e.g., video clips and animations), and sound.



<br>

## The Interaction Design Phase

- Dialogue design focuses on how information is provided to and captured from users during a specific task. 
  - Dialogues are analogous to a conversation between two people. 
  - Many existing interaction styles, such as menus, form-fill-ins,natural languages, dialog boxes, and direct manipulation, can be used. 



<br>

## The Interaction Design Phase

- Presentation design 
  - maximize visibility; 
  - minimize search time; 
  - provide structure and sequence of display; 
  - focus user attention on key data 
  - comprehended; 
  - provide only relevant information; and 
  - don’t overload user’s working memory.



<br>

## Formative Evaluations

- Formative evaluations identify defects in designs, thus informing design iterations and refinements. 
  - A number of different formative evaluations can occur several times during the design stage to form final decisions. 
  - In fact, it is strongly recommended that formative evaluations occur during the entire HCI development life cycle



<br>

## The Implementation Phase

- HCI development in this phase includes 
  - (1) prototyping, 
  - (2) formative evaluations to fine-tune the system, 
  - (3) summative evaluation before system release and 
  - (4) use evaluation after the system is installed and 
    being used by targeted users for a period of time.

<br>

## Applying the HCI Development Methodology: e-Gourmet example

- Figure below depicts two possible designs for the top level layout, media selection and presentation design considerations that should help users develop appropriate mental models of the website.

![image-20221010143601196](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010143601196.png)



<br>

## Applying the HCI Development Methodology: e-Gourmet example

- The Figure shows two possible designs for supporting this task. 
- The (b) design allows a user to easily navigate the website, 
- while the (a) design requires the user to go back to the previous page in order to go to other places of the website. 
- Such a small difference in design can cause a big difference in user’s experience in using the website. Having the navigation bar on the page is the result of a workflow analysis during task analysis.

## Summary

- This chapter posits the HCI development in the overall system development life cycle by presenting the human-centered SDLC (HCSDLC) model first, and then emphasizes the HCI development aspect.
- HCSDLC is an integrated methodology that emphasizes humancenterednessand considers HCI issues together with SA&D issuesthroughout the entire system development life cycle. 
- The HCI part of the HCSDLC methodology can be used alone to concentrate on the HCI development of an information system.
- In this chapter, we provide very detailed materials on HCI development methodology. 
- A HCI Development Report template is used to summarize the activities and deliverables of the methodology. 
- Examples are also used to illustrate how to apply the methodology.
