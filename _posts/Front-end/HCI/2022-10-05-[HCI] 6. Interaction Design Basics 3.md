## Across countries and cultures

- Localisation & internationalisation
  - changing interfaces for particular cultures/languages
- Globalisation
  - try to choose symbols etc. that work everywhere
- Simply change language?
  - use ‘resource’ database instead of literal text
    … but changes sizes, left-right order etc.
- Deeper issues
  - cultural assumptions and values
  - meanings of symbols
  - e.g tick(√) and cross(x) … +ve and -ve in some cultures
    … but … mean the same thing (mark this) in others

## Iteration and prototyping

- Getting better …
- … And starting well



<br>

## Prototyping

- You never get it right first time
- If at first you don’t succeed …

## Pitfalls of prototyping

![image-20221010141336534](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141336534.png)



<br>

## Some methods of prototyping

- UI builders (Visual Studio, ...)

  - draw a GUI visually by dragging and dropping UI controls 
    on screen
  - in the past, was done in simple languages like Visual 
    Basic
  - modern IDEs have UI builders for more robust languages 
    such as Java

- implementation by hand

  - writing a "quick" version of your code

<br>

## Paper prototyping

- paper prototyping:
  a means of usability testing where representative users perform tasks by interacting with a paper version of a user interface
- Why paper prototype?
  Why not just code up a working prototype?



- paper prototype is much faster to create than code
- can make changes to paper faster than code (editable)
- paper has more visual bandwidth (can see more at once)
- paper prototyping is more conducive to working in teams than most programming or normal prototyping
- paper prototyping can be done by non-technical people, or people with programming experience in different languages



<br>

## Comparison of techniques

![image-20221010141443031](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141443031.png)



<br>

## Where does P.P. fit in?

- At what point in the software lifecycle should we do 
(paper) prototyping? When would it be most useful 
to do it? Why?
- We talk about requirements being about "what" and design being about "how." Which is paper prototyping?



- PP helps us uncover requirements and also upcoming design issues
- do PP during or after requirements analysis; before design
- "what" vs. "how": PP shows us "what" is in the UI, but it also shows us details of "how" the user can achieve their goals in the UI; I categorize it as "how"



<br>

## A paper prot. usability session

- user is given tasks to perform using the paper 
  prototype
- session can be observed by people or camera
- one developer can "play computer“ – Wizard of Oz

<br>

## UI design, components

- When should we use:
  - A button?
  - A check box?
  - A radio button? 
  - A text field?
  - A list?
  - A combo box?
  - A menu?
  - A dialog box?
  - Other..?

![image-20221010141558882](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141558882.png)



<br>

## UI design - buttons, menus

- use buttons for single independent actions that are relevant to the current screen
  - try to use button text with verb phrases such as "Save" or "Cancel", not generic: "OK", "Yes", "No"
  - use Mnemonics or Accelerators (Ctrl-S)
- use **toolbars** for common actions![image-20221010141632258](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141632258.png)
- use **menus** for infrequent actions that may be 
  applicable to many or all screens
  - Users hate menus! Try not to rely too much on menus. Provide another way to access the same functionality (toolbar, hotkey, etc)![image-20221010141638288](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141638288.png)



<br>

## UI design - checkboxes / radio

- use **check boxes** for on/off switches, when any one switch can be toggled irrespective of the others (often correspond to boolean values)
- use **radio buttons** for related choices, when only one choice can be activated at a time (often corresponds to enum / constant values)

![image-20221010141703659](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141703659.png)



<br>

## UI design - lists, combo boxes

- use **text fields** (usually with a label) when the user may type in anything they want![image-20221010141745950](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141745950.png)
- **use** lists when there are many fixed choices (too many for radio buttons) and you want all choices visible on screen at once – standard or drop-down![image-20221010141749737](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141749737.png)
- use combo boxes when there are many fixed choices, but you don't want to take up screen real estate by showing them all at once![image-20221010141754211](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141754211.png)
- use a **slider** or **spinner** for a numeric value![image-20221010141757884](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141757884.png)



<br>

## An example UI screen

- What can we say about this UI dialog? Did the designer choose the right components?
  - Let's assume there are 20 collections and 3 ways to search (by title, author, relevancy)

![image-20221010141859025](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141859025.png)



<br>

## UI design - multiple screens

- use a **tabbed pane** when there are many screens that the user may want to switch between at any moment![image-20221010141929036](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141929036.png)
- use a **CardLayout** to "swap" between screens when necessary (not switchable by user)![image-20221010141932498](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141932498.png)
- use **dialog boxes** or **option panes** to present temporary screens or options![image-20221010141935676](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010141935676.png)



<br>

## Creating a paper prototype

- gather materials
  - paper, pencils/pens
  - tape, scissors
  - highlighters, transparencies![image-20221010142002721](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142002721.png)
- identify the screens in your UI
  - consider use cases, inputs and outputs to user
- think about how to get from one screen to next
  - this will help choose between tabs, dialogs, etc.



<br>

## Application backgrounds

- draw the app background (the parts that matter for the prototyping) on its own, then lay the various subscreens on top of it

![image-20221010142014568](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142014568.png)



<br>

## Representing a changing UI

- layers of UI can be placed on top of background as user clicks various options

![image-20221010142028360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142028360.png)



<br>

## Representing interactive widgets

- buttons / check boxes: tape
- tabs, dialog boxes: index cards
- text fields: removable tape
- combo boxes: put the choices on a separate piece of 
  paper that pops up when they click
- selections: a highlighted piece of tape or 
  transparency
- disabled widgets: make a gray version that can sit on 
  top of the normal enabled version
- computer beeps: say "beep" (hah!)![image-20221010142047344](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142047344.png)

<br>

## Example full paper prototype

## Paper Prototyping Tools

- **A marker and a sheet of paper**
  - very basics: a marker and a sheet of paper. 
  - Paper prototyping is a fast, easy and fun way to get a first 
    impression on your concept. 
  - Paper prototyping is very accessible for people of all backgrounds. The lack of details in paper prototypes will make people focus more on the idea. 
  - colors and layouts are just not relevant at this stage of development.

![image-20221010142127026](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142127026.png)

<br>

- **PowerPoint / Keynote**
  - You can create a digital prototype with Microsoft Office PowerPoint or Apple Keynote.
  - If you’re not a designer, you should really start from the software that you have already mastered and have on your desktop, rather than other professional services.![image-20221010142148368](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142148368.png)

<br>

- **Smartphone sketch templates**
  - For apps and other digital services, smartphone sketches are a great way to start. 
  - These useful templates with or without a precision grid to get you started. Translate your app ideas into real screen designs, perfect to test product assumptions with your customers.![image-20221010142214564](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142214564.png)

![image-20221010142211707](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142211707.png)

<br>

- **Explainer videos:** 
  **Whiteboard & Animated Explainers**
  - The easiest way to explain your solution is by telling a story.
  - Explainer videos give you the opportunity to share your concept with hundreds of potential customers via social media and to get instant quantitative and qualitative feedback.
  - You can use video capture tools for this purpose![image-20221010142317543](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010142317543.png)



<br>

- Graphic tools: Sketch/Photoshop

  - Sketch is made solely for turning your wireframes into great looking designs. Sketch also has an abundance of templates to make your prototyping just that bit faster.

  - The downfall of this gem is that it’s only available on Apple computers.

  - Photoshop is a great tool to transform your wireframes into beautiful designs.

  - It’s not made for prototyping,but it does a great job of using it for that purpose.

## Dedicated Paper Prototyping Programs

- POP by Marvel
  - The POP (Prototype On Paper) bridges the gap between paper and digital prototype by helping you make onscreen links between several paper prototype sketches.
- Proto.io
  - Proto.io lets you create high-fidelityprototypes of Apps, with ready-made libraries and elements such as menus, buttons, and more.
- Invision
  - It is similar to POP. But Invision offers many cooperative work functions
