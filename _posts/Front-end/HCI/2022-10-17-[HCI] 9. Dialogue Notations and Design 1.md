## Dialogue Notations and Design

- Dialogue Notations
  - Diagrammatic(그림으로 그릴 수 있는)
    - State transition networks, JSD (Jackson Structured Design) diagrams, Flow charts(플로우차트)
  - Textual(텍스트 형식)
    - Formal grammars, Production rules, CSP (Communication Sequential
      Process)
- Dialogue linked to
  - The semantics of the system – what it does
  - The presentation of the system – how it looks
- Formal descriptions can be analyzed
  - For inconsistent actions
  - For difficult to reverse actions
  - For missing actions
  - For potential miskeying errors(엉뚱한 거 잘못눌러서 생기는 error)

​	

<br>

## What is dialogue?

- Conversation between two or more parties
- Usually cooperative
- In user interfaces![image-20221010155431809](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155431809.png)
  - Refers to the structure of the interaction
  - Syntactic level of **human–computer ‘conversation’**
- Levels
  - Lexical (어휘)– shape of icons, actual keys pressed
  - Syntactic – order of inputs and outputs(어떤 순서로 눌러야 dialogue가 나오는지)
  - Semantic – effect on internal application/data



<br>

## Structured Human Dialogue

- Human-computer dialogue is very constrained
- Some human-human dialogue is formal too …
  - 사람과 사람의 대화도 fix 되어 있는 경우가 있음

(marriage dialogue)

<br>

## Lessons about Dialogue

- Wedding service
  - Sort of **script** for three parties
  - Specifies order
  - Some contributions fixed – “I do”
    - 몇몇은 고정된 말
  - Others variable – “do you man’s name …”
    - 사람 이름은 변수로 작용(사람마다 이름을 다르게 불러야 하기 때문에)
  - Instructions for ring
    concurrent with saying words “with this ring …”
- If you say these words, are you married?
  - Only if in the right place, with marriage **licence**
  - Syntax is not semantics
    - syntax가 지켜진다고 해도 semantic이 맞지 않으면 동작하지 않는 것



<br>

## … and more(예외 사항)

- What if woman says “I don’t”?
- Real dialogues often have **alternatives**:
  - ![image-20221010155528104](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155528104.png)
  - The process of the trial depends on the defendants response
- Focus on **normative responses**
  - Doesn’t cope with judge saying “off with her head”
    - 머리를 날려버려와 같은 말을 할 수 있는 것도 아니고...
  - Or in computer dialogue user standing on keyboard!



<br>

## Dialogue Design Notations

- Dialogue gets buried in the program
  - 프로그램 안 쪽에 깊이 있을 것임

- In a big system can we:
  - Analyse the dialogue:
    - e.g. Can the user always get to see current **shopping basket**
  - Change **platforms**
    - e.g. migration from Windows to Mac
  - **Dialogue notations** helps us to
    - Analyse systems
    - Separate lexical from semantic (어휘와 의미 분류)
- … and before the system is built
  - Notations help us understand proposed designs



<br>

## Graphical Notations

- State-Transition Nets (STN)
- Petri Nets
- State Charts
- Flow Charts
- Jackson Structured Design (JSD) Diagrams



<br>

## State Transition Networks (STN)

- Circles - states
- Arcs – actions (output) / events (input)

![image-20221010155630038](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155630038.png)

<br>

## State Transition Networks - Events

- Arc labels a bit cramped because:
- Notation is ‘state heavy’
- The events require most detail

![image-20221010155649582](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155649582.png)

<br>

## State Transition Networks - States

- Labels in circles a bit uninformative:
  - States are hard to name
  - But easier to visualise


![image-20221010155707130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155707130.png)

state가 unique하지 않고 state가 10개쯤 나오는 경우가 생기면 이름 짓기가 어려움

- 비슷한 종류의 작업이 있어도 이름을 다르게 해야하기 때문

<br>

## Example: Bottle Dispense STN

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79521972/196083074-389bb071-c89a-47ac-958c-34ecc793e472.png)



H state: history

<br>

## Hierarchical STNs

- Managing complex dialogues
- Named sub-dialogues

![image-20221010155731957](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155731957.png)



<br>

## Strengths and Limitations

- Strengths
  - Easy to interpret
  - Allows choice and iteration to be modelled.
- Limitations
  - Concurrent dialogue(왜 문제? - 아래에서 나옴)
  - Unusual actions (esc, help)

<br>

## Concurrent dialogues - ISimple dialogue box

![image-20221010155756039](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155756039.png)



<br>

## Concurrent dialogues - IIThree toggles - Individual STNs

![image-20221010155816898](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155816898.png)



<br>

## Concurrent dialogues - III Bold and Italic combined

![image-20221010155829177](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155829177.png)



<br>

## Concurrent dialogues - IV All together - Combinatorial explosion

![image-20221010155838527](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155838527.png)



<br>

## Escapes

- ‘Back’ in web, escape/cancel keys
  - Similar behavior everywhere
  - End up with spaghetti of identical behaviors 
- Try to avoid this
- e.g. on high level diagram
  - ‘Normal’ exit foreach submenu
  - Separateescape arc active‘everywhere’ in submenu

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79521972/196083942-ff4dbe0b-294e-45ac-8538-68b0a6677232.png)

<br>

## Help menus

- Similar problems
  - Nearly the same everywhere
  - But return to same point in dialogue
  - Could specify on STN … but very messy
  - Usually best added at a ‘meta’ level

![image-20221010155927059](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155927059.png)



<br>

## Petri Nets

- One of the oldest notations in computing!![image-20221010155950985](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010155950985.png)
  - A simple model of active behavior
  - Provide a graphical explanation for easy understanding.
- Four elements of Flow graph:
  - **Places**: Used to symbolize passive elements of the reactive system. A place is represented by a circle.
  - **Transitions**: Used to symbolize active elements of the reactive system. Transitions are represented by squares/rectangles.
  - **Arc**: Used to represent causal relations. Arc is represented by arrows.
  - **Token**: Sit on places (current state). Subject to change. Tokens are represented by small filled circles.
    - 토큰이 네트워크 안을 돌아다님
  - 토큰을 주고 받는 형태로 일을 한다.(토큰이 있는 곳이 현재 state)
  
  

<br>

## Role of a Token

- A physical object, for example a product, a part, a drug, a person 
- An information object, for example a message, a 
signal, a report
- A collection of objects, for example a truck with products, a warehouse with parts, or an address file
- An indicator of a state, for example the indicator of the state in which a process is, or the state of an object
- An indicator of a condition: the presence of a token indicates whether a certain condition is fulfilled
- Several tokens allowed: Concurrent dialogue states



<br>

## Role of a Place

- A type of communication medium, like a telephone line, a middleman, or a communication network
- A buffer: for example, a depot, a queue or a post bin
- A **geographical location**, like a place in a warehouse, office or hospital
- A possible state or state condition: for example, the floor where an elevator is, or the condition that a specialist is available



<br>

## Role of a Transition

- An event (e.g., starting an operation, the switching of a traffic light from red to green)
- A transformation of an object, like adapting a product, updating a database, or updating a document
- A transport of an object: for example, transporting goods, or sending a file



<br>

## Construction Rules

- Connections are directed(방향성이 존재)
- No connections between two places or two transitions is allowed
  - place와 place, transition과 transition끼리 연결될 수는 없음
  - 반드시 transition을 거쳐서 place로 가야됨.

- Places may hold zero or more tokens
- A transition is enabled if each of its input places contains at least one token

 ![image-20221010160101228](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160101228.png)

leave transition

각각에 하나씩 하나 이상의 토큰이 있어야 동작

enter: photographer가 프리이고 customer가 before로 갈 때

<br>

## Petri Net example

![image-20221010160112486](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160112486.png)

bold on에서 bold off로 토큰이 넘어감.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

<br>

## Example: In a Restaurant

![image-20221010160120866](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160120866.png)

waiter가 free여야 customers가 order를 받을 수 있음

<br>

## Example: In a Restaurant (Scenarios)

- Scenario 1:
  - Start 
    - -> Waiter takes order from customer 1
    - -> serves customer 1
    - -> takes order from customer 2
    - -> serves customer 2 => End
- Scenario 2:
  - Start 
    - -> Waiter takes order from customer 1
    - -> takes order from customer 2
    - -> serves customer 2
    - -> serves customer 1 => End

시나리오 1이 안되면 customer 2는 매우 오래 기다려야 할 것이므로 불만이 생길 것이다.

<br>

## Example: In a Restaurant (Scenario 1)

![image-20221010160226413](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160226413.png)



<br>

## Example: In a Restaurant (Scenario 2)

![image-20221010160235640](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160235640.png)

둘 중에 결정하는 transition은 없음

두 개가 한꺼번에 만족 되면 그 중 하나의 transition으로만 이동해야 함.

- 어느쪽으로 갈지는 여기서는 결정 하지 않음

<br>

## State Charts

- Harel’s state charts are a form of STN, to address problems.
- Hierarchy is used within a single diagram to show alternative and concurrent states.
- Used in UML (Unified Modelling Language)
- Extension to STN
- Example Problem: A television control panel.
  - The controller has five buttons “on”, “off”, “mute”, “sel” and “reset”
  - The TV is either ON or in STANDBY mode
  - When On, user can control the sound with the Mute button and the channel with the Sel Button.



<br>

## State Charts (A television control panel)

- Extension to STN
  - Hierarchy
  - Two concurrent sub-nets
  - Escapes
    - OFF always active

  - History
    - Link marked H goes back to last state on re-entering subdialogue


![image-20221010160313667](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160313667.png)

H: history ; 이전 상태

reset 버튼 누르면 default 값( Initial state)으로 간다.

<br>

## Three Toggles

- Toggles now tidy to represent in State Charts

![image-20221010160325130](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160325130.png)



<br>

## Flowcharts

- Familiar toprogrammers
- Boxes
  - Process/Event
  - Not state
- Use for dialogue (not internal algorithm)

![image-20221010160345767](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160345767.png)



<br>

## It works!

- Formal notations – too much work?
- COBOL transaction processing
  - Event-driven – like web interfaces 
  - **Programs structure** ≠ dialogue structure
    - 그냥 다음 프로세스가 무엇인지를 알려주는 구조
- Used dialogue flow charts
  - Discuss with clients
  - Transform to code
  - Systematic testing
  - 1000% productivity gain
- Formalism saves time!!



<br>

## JSD Diagrams

- Jackson Structured Design (JSD)
- For **tree** structured dialogues
  - Sequence determined left to right
  - Less expressive
  - Greater clarity


![image-20221010160427780](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010160427780.png)

- *은 iteration 표시

- 동그라미는 option으로 여러 선택지 중 하나를 수행(left에서 right으로 가는 것이 아니라)
