## Textual Notations

- Grammars
- Production rules
- Communication Sequential Process (CSP) and event algebras



<br>

## Textual - Grammars

- Regular expressionssel-line click click* dble-click
  - Equivalent expressiveness to JSD
  - Good for certain kinds of dialogue such as command line syntax
- BNF (Backus Normal Form)
  expr ::= empty
             | atom expr
             | '(' expr ')' expr
  - More powerful than regular exp. or STNs
  - Iteration through recursive definitions
  - Still NO concurrent dialogue



<br>

## Production Rules

- Unordered list of rules
- If **condition** then **action**
  - Conditions: user initiated events and current state
  - Actions: response to user or change to system’s state
    - E.g. Select-line -> start-line \<highlight ‘line’>
    - Click start-line -> rest-line \<rubber band on>
  - Two forms:
    - Event based: firing a rule removes its conditions from memory
    - State based: memory changed only if action explicitly specifies
- Every rule always potentially active
  - Good for concurrency
  - Bad for sequence



<br>

## Event based Production Rules

- if **condition** then **action**
  Sel-line null -> first
  C-point first -> rest
  C-point rest -> rest
  D-point rest -> \< draw line >
- Note:
  - Events added to list of pending events
  - ‘first’ and ‘rest’ are internally generated events
- Bad at state!



<br>

## Propositional Production System

- State based
- Attributes:
  - Mouse: { mouse-off, select-line, click-point, double-click }
  - Line-state: { menu, first, rest }
- Rules (feedback not shown):
  - select-line -> mouse-off, first
  - click-point, first -> mouse-off, rest
  - click-point, rest -> mouse-off, rest
  - double-click, rest -> mouse-off, menu
- Bad at events!



<br>

## Communication Sequential Process (CSP) and Process Algebras

- Used in Alexander's SPI (Specification, Prototyping and Interaction), and Agent notation
- Good for sequential dialogues
  - Bold-tog = select-bold? -> bold-on -> select-bold? ->bold-off -> Bold-tog
  - Italic-tog = . . .
  - Under-tog = . . .
- And concurrent dialogue
  - Dialogue-box = Bold-tog || Italic-tog || Under-tog
- But causality unclear



<br>

## Syntactic Dialogue Notations - Summary

- Diagrammatic
  - STN, JSD, Flow charts
- Textual
  - Grammars, Production rules, CSP
- Issues
  - Event based vs. State based
  - Power vs. Clarity
  - Model vs. Notation
  - Sequential vs. Concurrent



<br>

## Semantics - Alexander SPI (i)

- Two part specification:
  - EventCSP       - Pure dialogue order
  - EventISL          - Target dependent semantics
    * \* ISL: Interaction Specification Language
- Dialogue description – Centralized
- Syntactic/Semantic trade-off – Tolerable



<br>

## Semantics - Alexander SPI (ii)

- EventCSP
  Login = login-mess -> get-name -> Passwd
  Passwd = passwd-mess -> (invalid -> Login [ ] valid -> Session)
- EventISL

event: login-mess
					prompt: true
					out: “Login:”
event: get-name
					uses: input
					set: user-id = input
event: valid
					uses: input, user-id, passwd-db
					wgen: passwd-id = passwd-db(user-id)



<br>

## Semantics - Raw Code

- Event loop for word processor
- Dialogue description 
  - very distributed
- Syntactic/Semantic 
  trade-off
  - terrible!

<br>

## Action Properties

- Completeness
  - Only a subset of the full set of actions are allowed for any state.
  - But what about missed actions, not shown on the diagram?
  - Unforeseen circumstances: need to know the consequences of all actions under any event and account for them.
  - For each state/action pair, the designer ought to decide what the behavior will be.
- Determinism
  - Several arcs for one action
  - Deliberate: application decision
  - Accident: production rules
  - e.g. Nested escapes or actions may be dependent on guard conditions
- Consistency
  - We expect the same action in different states to do the same effect
  - e.g. modes and visibility



<br>

## Checking Properties (i)

- Completeness
  - Double-click in circle states?



![image-20221010161050271](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161050271.png)

<br>

## State Properties

- Reachability
  - Can you get anywhere from anywhere?
  - And how easily
- Reversibility
  - Can you get to the previous state?
  - But NOT undo
- Dangerous states
  - Some states you don't want to get to
  - Some states must be made difficult to reach (disk format !)
  - Dangerous states can’t be determined automatically
  - The move to dangerous states must be different from other sequences (not-consistent!)



<br>

## Checking Properties (ii)

- Reversibility:
- To reverse select `line'

![image-20221010161121552](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161121552.png)



<br>

## Checking Properties (ii)

- Reversibility:
- To reverse select `line'
- Click

![image-20221010161138154](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161138154.png)



<br>

## Checking Properties (ii)

![image-20221010161149994](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161149994.png)



<br>

## Checking Properties (ii)

![image-20221010161158809](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161158809.png)



<br>

## Dangerous States

![image-20221010161207295](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161207295.png)



<br>

## Dangerous States (ii)

- Exit with/without save => dangerous states
- Duplicate states - semantic distinction

![image-20221010161227837](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161227837.png)

- F1-F2 - exit with save
- F1-Esc-F2 - exit with no save



<br>

## Lexical Issues

- Visibility
  - Differentiate modes and states
  - Annotations to dialogue
- Style
  - Command - verb noun (e.g. delete files)
  - Mouse based - noun verb (e.g. move files to trashcan)
- Layout
  - Not just appearance ...



<br>

## Layout Matters

- Word processor - Dangerous states

![image-20221010161302697](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161302697.png)

- Old keyboard - OK

## Dialogue Analysis - Summary

- Semantics and dialogue
  - Attaching semantics
  - Distributed/centralized dialogue description
  - Maximizing syntactic description
- Properties of dialogue
  - Action properties: completeness, determinism, consistency
  - State properties: reachability, reversibility, dangerous states
- Presentation and lexical issues
  - Visibility, style, layout
  - N.B. not independent of dialogue

- and ...
- That’s just one button to change modes![image-20221010161621281](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speardragon/save-image-repo/main/img/image-20221010161621281.png)
