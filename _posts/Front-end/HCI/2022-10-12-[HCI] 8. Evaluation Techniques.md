## Evaluation Techniques

- Evaluation
  - Tests usability and functionality of system
  - Occurs in laboratory, field and/or in collaboration with users
  - Evaluates both design and implementation
  - **Should be considered at all stages in the design life cycle**



<br>

## Goals of Evaluation

- Assess extent of system functionality
- Assess effect of interface on user
- Identify specific problems



<br>

## Evaluating Designs

- Expert-based Evaluation
  - Cognitive Walkthrough
  - Heuristic Evaluation
  - Review-based Evaluation
- Model-based Evaluation
- User-based Evaluation



<br>

## Cognitive Walkthrough

- Proposed by Polson et al.
  - Evaluates design on how well it supports user in learning task
  - Usually performed by expert in cognitive psychology
  - Expert ‘walks though’ design to identify potential **problems** using psychological principles
    - 가이드 제공
    - 심리학적 원리를 사용하여 잠재적인 문제를 식별하기 위한 전문가 '자세한 설명' 설계
  - Forms used to guide analysis



<br>

## Cognitive Walkthrough (cont)

- For each task walkthrough considers
  - What impact will interaction have on user?
  - What cognitive processes are required?
  - What learning problems may occur?
- Analysis focuses on goals and knowledge: does the design lead the user to generate the correct goals?



<br>

## Heuristic Evaluation

의식의 흐름보다 이런 건 꼭 하면 좋겠다.(좀 더 **형식적인**)

- Proposed by Nielsen and Molich.
- **Usability criteria (heuristics)** are identified
- Design examined by experts to see if these are violated
- Example heuristics
  - System behaviour is predictable (예측가능성)
  - System behaviour is consistent (일관성)
  - Feedback is provided (피드백 제공 여부)
- Heuristic evaluation ‘debugs’ design.



<br>

## Ten Usability Heuristics for UI Design

1. Visibility of system status
   - 현재 내가 진행하는 프로세스가 보이는지
2. Match between system and the real world
   - 유저 입장에서 현실세계와 시스템을 매칭할 수 있는지
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
   - 메뉴를 보고 바로 무슨 행동을 하는 지 알수 있도록
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation



<br>

## Review-based evaluation

- Experimental results and empirical evidence from the literature (e.g., from psychology, HCI, etc) can be used to support or refute parts of design. 
- It is expensive to repeat experiments continually and therefore a review of relevant literature can save resources (e.g., effort, time, finances, etc). 
  - 실험을 지속적으로 반복하는 것은 비용이 많이 들기 때문에 관련 문헌을 검토하면 자원을 절약할 수 있다.

- However, care should be taken to ensure results are transferable to the new design (e.g., note the design in consideration, the user audience, the assumptions made, etc).
  - 그러나 결과가 새로운 설계로 이전될 수 있도록 주의해야 한다.




<br>

## Model-based evaluation

- Cognitive models can be used to filter design options
  e.g. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection) model can be used to predict user performance with a user interface, 
  keystroke-level model (KLM) can be used to predict performance for low-level tasks.
- Dialog models (e.g. STN: state transition model) can be used to evaluate dialog problems in a user interface 
  e.g. unreachable states, circular dialogs, etc.

<br>

### GOMS & KLM

- KLM or KLM-GOMS
  - Belongs to the family of GOMS models
  - Find more efficient ways to complete a task by analyzing
  - the steps required in the process
- The keystroke-level model consists of six operators
  - K: Press a Key or button time varies with user skill
  - P: Point with a mouse
  - H: Home to/from keyboard or other device
  - D(n,l): Draw n straight lines of total length l
  - M: Mentally prepare
  - R(t): Response by system



<br>

## User-based Evaluation

- User-based evaluation basically is evaluation through user participation, i.e. evaluation that involves the people for whom the system is intended; the users. 
- User-based evaluation techniques include: experimental methods, **observational methods**, query techniques (e.g., questionnaires and interviews), physiological monitoring methods (e.g., eye tracking, measuring skin conductance, measuring heart rate). 
- User-based methods can be conducted in the laboratory and/or in the field. 
- Two Cases
  - Laboratory Studies
  - Field Studies



<br>

### Laboratory Studies

- Advantages:
  - Specialist & equipment available
  - Uninterrupted environment
- Disadvantages:
  - Lack of context
  - Difficult to observe several users cooperating
- Appropriate
  - If system location is dangerous or impractical for constrained single user systems to allow controlled manipulation of use



<br>

### Field Studies

- Advantages:
  - Natural environment
  - Context retained (though observation may alter it)
  - Longitudinal(장기적인) studies possible
- Disadvantages:
  - Distractions
  - Noise
- Appropriate
  - Where context is crucial for longitudinal studies



<br>

## Evaluating Implementations

- Requires an artefact:
  - Simulation
  - Prototype
  - Full implementation



<br>

## Experimental Evaluation

- Controlled evaluation of specific aspects of interactive behaviour
- Evaluator chooses hypothesis to be tested
- A number of experimental conditions are considered which differ only in the value of some controlled variable.
- Changes in behavioural measure are attributed to different conditions



<br>

## Experimental Factors

- Subjects(실험대상)
  - Who – representative, sufficient sample
- Variables
  - Things to modify and measure
- Hypothesis
  - What you’d like to show
- Experimental design
  - How you are going to do it



<br>

## Variables

- Independent Variable (**IV**) - 입력
  - Characteristic changed to produce different conditions
    - 다른 조건을 생성하도록 변경된 특성
  - e.g. interface style, number of menu items
  
- Dependent Variable (**DV**) - 출력
  - Characteristics measured in the experiment(실험에서 측정된 특성)
  - e.g. time taken, number of errors.



<br>

## Hypothesis

- Prediction of Outcome
  - Framed in terms of IV and DV
  - e.g. “error rate will increase as font size decreases”
- Null hypothesis:
  - States no difference between conditions
  - Aim is to disprove this (이것을 반증하는 것이 목표)
  - e.g. null hyp. = “no change with font size”



<br>

## Experimental Design

- Within groups design
  - Each subject performs experiment under each condition.
  - Transfer of learning possible (학습 이전 가능)
  - Less costly and less likely to suffer from user variation.
- Between groups design
  - Each subject performs under only one condition
  - No transfer of learning 
  - More users required
  - Variation can bias results.



<br>

## Analysis of Data

- Before you start to do any statistics:
  - Look at data
  - Save original data
- Choice of statistical technique depends on
  - Type of data
  - Information required
  - Type of data
    - **Discrete** - finite number of values
    - **Continuous** - any value



<br>

## Analysis - Types of Test

- Parametric
  - 가정이 좀 있는 경우
  - Assume normal distribution
  - Robust
  - Powerful
- Non-parametric
  - Do not assume normal distribution
    - chi-square test
  - Less powerful
  - More reliable
- Contingency(보정) table
  - Classify data by discrete attributes 
  - Count number of data items in each group



<br>

## Analysis of Data (cont.)

- What information is required?
  - Is there a difference?
  - How big is the difference?
  - How accurate is the estimate?
- Parametric and non-parametric tests mainly address **first of these**



<br>

## Experimental Studies on Groups

- More difficult than single-user experiments
- Problems with:
  - Subject groups
  - Choice of task
  - Data gathering
  - Analysis



<br>

## Subject Groups

- Larger number of subjects
- more expensive
- Longer time to `settle down’
… even more variation!
- Difficult to timetable
- So … often only three or four groups



<br>

## The Task

- Must encourage cooperation(협력을 지향해야 함.)
- Perhaps involve multiple channels
- Options:
  - Creative task e.g. ‘write a short report on …’
  - Decision games e.g. desert survival task
  - Control task e.g. ARKola bottling plant



<br>

## Data Gathering

- Several video cameras + Direct logging of application
- Problems:
  - Synchronisation
  - Sheer volume!(엄청난 양의 데이터)
- One solution:
  - Record from each perspective(필요한 상황에 따라 하나씩 조정)

<br>

## Analysis

- N.B. Vast variation between groups(그룹 간 엄청난 변동)
  - e.g. democratic / dominandt'

- Solutions:
  - Within groups experiments
  - Micro-analysis (e.g., gaps in speech)
  - Anecdotal and qualitative analysis(입증되지 않고 질적인 분석)
- Look at interactions between group and media
- Controlled experiments may ‘waste’ resources!
  - if the number of experimental groups is limited




<br>

## Field Studies

- Experiments dominated by group formation
- Field studies more realistic:
  - Distributed cognition => work studied in context
  - Real action is situated action
  - Physical and social environment both crucial
- Contrast:
  - Psychology – controlled experiment(통제 실험)
  - Sociology and anthropology – open study and rich data
    - 사회학과 인류학 – 개방형 연구와 풍부한 데이터



<br>

## Observational Methods

- Think Aloud
- Cooperative evaluation
- Protocol analysis
- Automated analysis
- Post-task walkthroughs



<br>

### Think Aloud

- 유저가 자기가 하는 생각을 계속 description
  - **사용자는 실험자가 준 과제를 수행하면서 드는 생각을 바로바로 말하고,**
    **실험자는 그런 사용자를 관찰하는 실험중의 약속을 말합니다**

- User observed performing task(사용자가 작업 수행 중임을 확인함)
- User asked to describe what he is doing and why, what he thinks is happening etc.
  - 사용자는 자신이 무엇을 하고 있는지, 왜 그런지, 무슨 일이 일어나고 있다고 생각하는지 등을 설명하도록 요청된다.

- **Advantages**
  - Simplicity - requires little expertise (적은 전문성을 요구)
  - Can provide useful insight
  - Can show how system is actually used
- **Disadvantages**
  - Subjective
  - Selective
  - Act of describing may alter task performance
    - 기술하는 행위는 작업 성과를 변화시킬 수 있다.



<br>

### Cooperative Evaluation

- Variation on think aloud
- User collaborates in evaluation(사용자가 평가에 공동 작업)
- Both user and evaluator can ask each other questions throughout
  - 사용자와 평가자 모두 내내 서로에게 질문을 할 수 있다.

- Additional advantages
  - Less constrained and easier to use
  - User is encouraged to criticize(비판) system
  - Clarification possible(명확화 가능)



<br>

### Protocol Analysis

- Paper and pencil – cheap, limited to writing speed
- Audio – good for think aloud, difficult to match with other protocols
- Video – accurate and realistic, needs **special equipment,** obtrusive(눈에 띄는) sometimes
- Computer logging – automatic and unobtrusive, large amounts of data difficult to analyze
- User notebooks – coarse and subjective, useful insights, good for longitudinal studies
- Mixed use in practice.
  - Audio/video transcription difficult and requires skill.
  - Some automatic support tools available



<br>

### Automated Analysis – Video Annotation

- Interface
  - How many objects should we annotate(주석을 달다) at once?
  - How do we visualize space and time?
  - How do we select key frames?
- Crowdsourcing
  - How do we split up work?
  - How do we do quality control?
- Interpolation / Tracking
  - How do we learn the appearance of an object?
  - How do we interpolate to minimize effort?



<br>

### Post-task Walkthroughs

- User reacts **on action after the event**
- Useful to identify reasons for actions and alternatives considered
  - 검토된 조치 및 대안에 대한 이유를 식별하는 데 유용함

- Necessary in cases where think aloud is not possible
  - think aloud가 불가능한 경우에 필요하다.

- Transcript played back to participant for comment
  - 설명을 위해 참가자에게 대화 내용을 재생했습니다.
  - Immediately => fresh in mind
  - Delayed => evaluator has time to identify questions

- **Advantages**
  - Analyst has time to focus on relevant incidents
  - Avoid excessive interruption of task 
    - 과도한 작업 중단 방지
- **Disadvantages**
  - Lack of freshness
  - May be post-hoc interpretation of events
    - 이벤트에 대한 사후 해석일 수 있습니다.
  - 이벤트 끝나고 나서 자기가 다시 평가하는 것에 묶임?(bias 되어 버림)

<br>

## Query Techniques

- Interviews
- Questionnaires



<br>

## Interviews

- Analyst questions user on one-to-one basis usually based on prepared questions
- Informal, subjective and relatively **cheap**
- **Advantages**
  - Can be varied to suit context(상황에 맞게 변경 가능)
  - Issues can be explored more fully(문제를 보다 완벽하게 탐색할 수 있습니다.)
  - Can elicit user views and identify unanticipated problems
    - 사용자 뷰를 유도하고 예상치 못한 문제를 식별할 수 있습니다.
- **Disadvantages**
  - Very subjective(매우 주관적)
  - Time consuming



<br>

## Questionnaires

- Set of fixed questions given to users
- **Advantages**
  - Quick and reaches large user **group**
  - Can be analyzed more rigorously(엄격하게)
- **Disadvantages**
  - Less flexible
  - Less probing



<br>

## Questionnaires (cont.)

- Need careful design
  - What information is required?
  - How are answers to be analyzed?
- Styles of question
  - General
  - Open-ended
  - Scalar
  - Multi-choice
  - Ranked



<br>

## Physiological Methods

- Eye tracking
- Physiological measurement



<br>

## Eye Tracking

- Head or desk mounted equipment tracks the position of the eye
- Eye movement reflects the amount of cognitive processing a display requires
- Measurements include
  - Fixations: eye maintains stable position. Number and duration indicate level of difficulty with display
  - Saccades: rapid eye movement from one point of interest to another
    - **청각 또는 시자극에 의해 무의식적으로 시 선을 옮기는 것**
  - Scan paths: moving straight to a target with a short fixation at the target is optimal
    - 표적에 짧은 고정으로 표적으로 바로 이동하는 것이 최적입니다.



<br>

## Physiological Measurements

- Emotional response linked to physical changes
- These may help determine a user’s reaction to an interface
- Measurements include:
  - Heart activity, including blood pressure, volume and pulse. 
  - Activity of sweat glands(땀샘의 활동): Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
  - Electrical activity in muscle: electromyogram (EMG)
  - Electrical activity in brain: electroencephalogram (EEG)
- Some difficulty in interpreting these physiological responses - more research needed



<br>

## Choosing an Evaluation Method

- When in process: design vs. implementation
- Style of evaluation: laboratory vs. field
- How objective: subjective vs. objective
- Type of measures: qualitative vs. quantitative
- Level of information: high level vs. low level
- Level of interference: obtrusive vs. unobtrusive
- Resources available: time, subjects, equipment, expertise
